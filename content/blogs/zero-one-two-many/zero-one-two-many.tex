As has been observed above
\protect\hyperlink{ref-perlcookbook2003}{{[}1{]}}, in the context of
computer programming, there are only three numbers worth being concerned
about: zero, one, and many. And if you are into the arcana of
\href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions}{``regular
expressions''} and
\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=pattern+matching}{``pattern
matching''}---which is, incidentally, something done implicitly every
time you do a Google search, or look for a book at an online
bookstore---that is very sage advice. But how serviceable is this dictum
in everyday life?

\hypertarget{a-real-life-scenario}{%
\subsection{A real-life scenario}\label{a-real-life-scenario}}

Let us assume that you are living alone, but have decided to invite
friends for a Halloween party. You had at first assumed that the full
\href{https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cohort}{cohort} of fifty or
so friends to whom you sent invitations were all going to turn up, but
had later revised that estimate to half that number. You shop and
eagerly prepare sufficient food and drink for the festive occasion.
Exhausted but elated with anticipation, you finally finish the chores,
sit back, heave a sigh of relief, and wait for your friends.

As the clock ticks
\href{https://www.thefreedictionary.com/inexorably}{inexorably} toward
the appointed hour, you watch the door but there are no early birds. You
stay patient and console yourself that perhaps they will turn up just on
time. The awaited hour comes and goes and still no one has shown up.

Meanwhile, you get a series of emails, text messages, and phone calls
from your friends, who all mysteriously claim, that at the last minute
some unforeseen circumstance prevents their presence. They convey their
apologies for not turning up. A full hour after the scheduled time for
dinner, you reluctantly decide that nobody is going to turn up after
all.

\hypertarget{zero}{%
\subsection{Zero}\label{zero}}

And there you have it: the number zero. It is catastrophic on occasion,
as when you have zero guests turning up, or you have scored zero marks
in the examination, or zero goals in the soccer match. A zero bank
balance can drive you to drink, or up the wall, or worse. Having zero
cavities when you visit the dentist, however, is cause for celebration.
So, zero, although it is nothing, is paradoxically, something to be
reckoned with. And something very powerful at that.

\hypertarget{one}{%
\subsection{One}\label{one}}

Think of yourself: the only and lonely consumer of food at your festive
banquet. Left to sup alone and without the cheer of convivial company,
you nevertheless count. You, the subject are always there, and
therefore, the number one has a subjective significance that rivals only
that of zero. In life, each of has only one body. And even if we had a
dozen houses spread across five continents, we can occupy only one at
any one time. The number one imposes some fundamental constraints on our
lives.

But one has another magical, mathematical property. If you add one to
one, you get two. If you add one to two, you get three, and so on. So,
any number that you care to name can be generated by adding one to
itself that many times but one! If that sounds too complicated for you,
you can equally say that any number can be generated by adding one to
zero that number of times. Note, however, that this magic requires the
number one. Adding zero to itself does us no good in creating new
numbers. One needs to add one to zero before the brewing begins.

So, both zero and one are powerful numbers. They hold within themselves
the whole menagerie of numbers. Indeed, our modern civilization, built
as it is on computers and the binary number system, has the numbers zero
and one at its technological foundations. But are there any other
powerful and important numbers besides these two?

\hypertarget{two}{%
\subsection{Two}\label{two}}

I nominate the number two. The saying, ``It takes two to tango'' takes
on a new meaning in the world of chemistry, physics, and biology.

In chemistry, elements react with each other to try to attain
configurations in which there are eight electrons or completed octets.
And eight is two cubed. This quest to make eight, either by sharing or
tearing electrons is what gives elements their reactivity. It is what
drives poisonous chlorine and combustible sodium to form physiologically
benign sodium chloride or common salt. And even the lightest of the rare
gases, helium, tries to attain a stable configuration whereby two helium
atoms cohabit to form one helium molecule. Evidence again of the power
of two.

Physics relies on repeatable measurements. And all measurements rely on
comparisons. When you weigh one kilogram of beans, you are really
comparing the weight of the beans with a weight that is known to be one
kilogram. If you are using a commercial scale, which relies on spring
tension, you are really comparing the tension or compression on the
spring produced by the beans with the tension or compression from the
known one kilogram weight. And this is as true with time, distance, and
anything else you care to measure, as it is with weight. All
measurements are comparisons, and for that we need two.

In biology, there is the famous double helix: DNA or the molecule of
life is known to be like a spiral staircase or twisted ladder. But why
two? Why not one? Or zero? Or three? Very likely because Mother Nature
knew, before us, that all comparisons need two. And if you want to make
a copy of something, you need to compare the copy with the original.
Since life is really a process of copying, with elegant and random
variations thrown in (assuming that you are not totally allergic to the
Theory of Evolution) then, two rules again.

Another possible reason for life's affinity with two is the insurance
provided by redundancy. We have two kidneys, two ears, two eyes, etc.,
primarily because of aesthetics, balance, and design elegance, but
secondarily because of redundancy. Someone who has lost hearing in one
ear or sight in one eye can still hear or see. They might have lost the
ability to localize sound or perceive depth, but the sensory channels
are still functional.

The number two and its powers are also at the heart of cellular fusion
during conception where two---sperm and ovum---become one embryo or
zygote. And with subsequent cellular division, the primary embryonic
cell becomes two. So life's tango is really two =\textgreater{} one
=\textgreater{} two, over and over again.

\hypertarget{to-sum-up}{%
\subsection{To sum up}\label{to-sum-up}}

To sum up, zero and one are mathematically profound. The number two
comes into its own with matter, measurement, and life. But what about
the other numbers? What about three, or thirty-seven, or three hundred
and thirty million? They might each be interesting in their own right
and have some endearing virtue or peculiarity, but these other numbers
are not lynchpins. The appellation ``many'' will do for them.

Moreover, not giving these other numbers special distinction is
something we have done many times already. In the grammars for most
languages, only two numbers are recognized: singular and plural, one and
many. The automatic matching of singular nouns with singular verbs, and
plural nouns with plural verbs, is a chore to automate with reports
generated by computing languages. And that is because the number one is
special. Beyond it, we only think of many. But bear in mind that ancient
languages like Greek and Sanskrit had three numbers in grammar:
singular, dual, and plural. And that, I think is giving the numbers one
and two their fair share of distinction. And oh! To speak nothing of
nothing will not do, so, naught or nought, must be there too!

Vive la zero, one, two, many!
