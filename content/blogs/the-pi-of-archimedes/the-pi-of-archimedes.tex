\begin{quote}
This blog began life more than two decades ago, as part of a series of
lectures I delivered to very bright first-year engineering students at
an Australian university.

The number \(\pi\) (pronounced ``pie'') has been recognized from time
immemorial because its physical significance can be grasped easily: it
is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. But who
would have thought that such an innocent ratio would exercise such
endless fascination because of the complexities enfolded into it?

Not surprisingly, some students I met recently wanted to know more about
\(\pi\). Accordingly, I have substantially recast and refreshed my
original presentation to better accord with the form and substance of a
blog. The online references have also been updated to keep up with a
rapidly changing Web.

My original intention was to write a single blog on \(\pi\). But because
I did not want it to become another overly long \emph{slog}, I have
decided to divide it into two parts.

If there are any errors or omissions, please
\href{mailto:feedback.swanlotus@gmail.com}{email} me your feedback.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Circumference, diameter, and
π}\label{circumference-diameter-and-ux3c0}

The straight line or
\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Geodesic.html}{geodesic} is the
shortest distance between any two points on a plane, sphere, or other
space. The circle is the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics)}{locus}
traversed by a moving point that is
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistant}{equidistant} from
another fixed point on a two-dimensional plane. It is the most
\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Symmetry.html}{symmetrical} figure
on the plane. The
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter}{diameter} is the name
given both to any straight line passing through the centre of the
circle---intersecting it at two points---as well as to its length. When
we divide the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter}{perimeter}
of circle, more properly called its
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference}{circumference},
\(C\), by its diameter, \(d\), we get the enigmatic constant \(\pi\),
which has a value between \(3.141\) and \(3.142\):
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:pi-Cd}{
\frac{C}{d} = \pi.
}\end{equation} The diameter \(d\) is twice the radius \(r\), and
substituting for \(d\) into \cref{eq:pi-Cd}, we get the well-known
school formula: \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:two-pi-r}{
C = \pi d = 2\pi r \approx 2\left[\frac{22}{7}\right]r \approx 6.28r.
}\end{equation} Note, however, that \(\pi\) is \emph{not exactly equal}
to \(\frac{22}{7}\). This value is a convenient \emph{rational fraction
approximation} for \(\pi\) that serves well in elementary
contexts.\footnote{See
  \href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/a-tale-of-two-measures-degrees-and-radians}{``A
  tale of two measures: degrees and radians''}.}

You might reasonably wonder whether the ratio of the circumference to
the diameter of \emph{any} circle is \emph{always} \(\pi\). The answer
is ``Yes'', because \emph{all circles are similar}. The ratios of
corresponding lengths of similar figures are equal. This idea is also
covered in my blog
\href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/a-tale-of-two-measures-degrees-and-radians}{``A
tale of two measures: degrees and radians''}.

The symbol \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi}{\(\pi\)} is the
lowercase version of the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet. For the
history of its use in mathematics, see
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi\#Adoption_of_the_symbol_\%CF\%80}{adoption
of the symbol π in Wikipedia}.

\begin{figure}

\caption{The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of \emph{any}
circle is \(\pi\).}\label{fig:pi-circle}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:pi-circle} shows the relationships in \cref{eq:pi-Cd} and
\cref{eq:two-pi-r} pictorially. The circumference of a circle is about
6.28 times its radius. Why this should be so is a secret, a mystery of
Nature.

\subsection{Is π = 22/7 an exact
value?}\label{is-ux3c0-227-an-exact-value}

Is \(\pi\) really equal to \(\frac{22}{7}\), as it has been drummed into
our heads at school? A wonderfully revealing story lies behind this
mysterious relationship, and it is due to the
\href{https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/labours}{labours}
of one man, in the days when calculators could not be dreamed of, and
when neither the decimal system of numbers nor trigonometry were known.
That is the story we look at next.

\subsection{Archimedes of Syracuse}\label{archimedes-of-syracuse}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes}{Archimedes of
Syracuse}\footnote{His very name, Archimedes, means ``master thinker''
  in Greek.} (Ἀρχιμήδης, 287--212 BCE) was a
\href{https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/polymath\#:~:text=Definitions\%20of\%20polymath,of\%20great\%20and\%20varied\%20learning}{polymath}
and genius of the ancient world. He was one of the greatest
mathematicians the world has ever known. By today's standards, he would
be called a mathematician, physicist, engineer, and astronomer,
\href{https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/all-rolled-into-one}{all
rolled into one}. He is perhaps most famous for running out of his
bathtub naked exclaiming
\href{https://www.dictionary.com/browse/eureka}{``Eureka''}---Greek for
``I have found it''---oblivious of those around him. The principle that
he had then discovered---that the upthrust on a body submerged in a
fluid is equal to the weight of fluid displaced---is known as
\href{https://www.britannica.com/science/Archimedes-principle}{Archimedes'
Principle}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/Domenico-Fetti_Archimedes_1620.jpg}
\caption[Archimedes of Syracuse.]{Archimedes of
Syracuse.\footnotemark{}}\label{fig:archimedes}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{Domenico Fetti's 1620 painting entitled \emph{Archimedes
  Thoughtful}. Public domain.}

Among the many accomplishments of Archimedes is his method for
estimating \(\pi\), which was the best approximation for almost 1900
years. And it was not based on using a length of string, superimposing
it on a circle, and getting an estimate! \emojifont {😉}\normalfont 

What is even more remarkable is that Archimedes made his discovery
\emph{without} the benefit of:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\item
  the real numbers;
\item
  algebra;
\item
  trigonometry;
\item
  decimal (positional) notation; and
\item
  calculators.
\end{enumerate}

Instead he applied the theorem of Pythagoras and extracted rational
values for square roots laboriously by hand. His method is also an
excellent geometrical illustration of the idea of a
\href{https://www.britannica.com/science/limit-mathematics}{\emph{limit}},
with which he was doubtless familiar. It is known that Archimedes was
familiar with what we now know as integral calculus, and it is possible
that he may have anticipated differential calculus as well.

Archimedes devised an ingenious method for estimating the circumference
of a circle. He used a sophisticated algorithm that allowed him to
obtain successively more accurate values for the circumference of a
circle, and therefore of \(\pi\).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/Archimedes-AI-generated-portrait.png}
\caption{Portrait of Archimedes generated by AI and available at the
Craiyon website
\href{https://www.craiyon.com/image/JEmP4rPCRW25xyCULOeMSw}{here}. All
portraits of Archimedes are flights of fancy rather than true
likenesses.}\label{fig:Archimedes-AI}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Principles used by
Archimedes}\label{principles-used-by-archimedes}

The method that Archimedes devised is instructive because it is a
synthesis of several principles by which the greatest human minds have
furthered scientific progress over time. The abstract principles that
Archimedes used to estimate \(\pi\) were these:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Start with the known and progress to the unknown;
\item
  Initialize variables;
\item
  Devise a method of increasing the accuracy of the estimate by
  \href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Recursion.html}{recursion} or
  \href{https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/iteration}{iteration};
\item
  Stop when the desired accuracy is reached.
\end{enumerate}

These principles constitute what is known as an
\href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm}{algorithm}.
Once such a systematic framework has been put in place, it can be
applied in many research domains to aid rapid scientific progress. The
algorithm is the basis of modern computing.

\subsubsection{Of polygons and circles}\label{of-polygons-and-circles}

Archimedes considered a circle, containing an
\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Inscribed.html}{inscribed} regular
polygon with \(n\) sides, and
\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circumscribed.html}{circumscribed}
by a regular polygon with the same \(n\) sides. \cref{fig:two-limits}
illustrates this for the case \(n = 6\), i.e., with a regular
\href{https://www.britannica.com/science/hexagon}{hexagon}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includesvg[width=0.7\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/two-limits.svg}
\caption{The circumference of the circle in darkolivegreen is bounded
from below by the perimeter of the inscribed regular hexagon in maroon
and bounded from above by the perimeter of the circumscribed regular
hexagon in midnightblue. The circumference of the circle must lie
between the perimeters of these two hexagons. The value \(r\) is the
radius of the circle and the height \(h\)---from the centre to the
mid-point of a side---is called the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothem}{apothem}.}\label{fig:two-limits}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includesvg[width=0.7\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/sin-theta-tan-theta.svg}
\caption{The relationship between the circle and its inscribed and
circumscribed regular polygons. The symbol \(h\) is used for the apothem
in both cases. Note that \(OD = h = r\cos\theta\) for the inscribed
polygon, whereas \(OC = h = r\) for the circumscribed
polygon.}\label{fig:sin-theta-tan-theta}
\end{figure}

Let us tabulate below the variables arising from
\cref{fig:two-limits,fig:sin-theta-tan-theta}.

\(C(n) = 2n\tan\theta r\) \\
\end{longtable}

When \(n\) varies, so do the values of \(\theta\) and the areas and
perimeters; they are therefore shown as functions of \(n\) in
\cref{tbl:variables}.

\subsubsection{Lower and upper bounds for
π}\label{lower-and-upper-bounds-for-ux3c0}

We assume that \(r = 1\) without loss of generality.
\cref{tbl:variables} and \cref{fig:sin-theta-tan-theta} together give us
these inequalities for regular \(n\)-gons where
\(\theta = \frac{180}{n}\) degrees or \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{n}\)
radians. \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:squeeze}{
\begin{aligned}
a(n) < A < A(n) &\implies n\sin\theta\cos\theta < \pi < n\tan\theta\\
c(n) < C < C(n) &\implies n\sin\theta < \pi < n\tan\theta
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

From the right hand side of \cref{eq:squeeze}, using the inequalities
for perimeters, we have
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:lower-bound}{
n\sin\tfrac{180°}{n} = n\sin\tfrac{\pi}{n}, \thinspace \mbox{for the lower bound}.
}\end{equation} \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:upper-bound}{
n\tan\tfrac{180°}{n} = n\tan\tfrac{\pi}{n}, \thinspace \mbox{for the lower bound}.
}\end{equation}

\cref{eq:lower-bound,eq:upper-bound} represent respectively the lower
and upper bounds on the value of \(\pi\) obtained through the method of
Archimedes.

Obviously, the circle may be viewed as a regular polygon whose number of
sides, \(n\) has become exceedingly large, or \emph{infinite}. So, as
\(n\) is increased, we should expect the two bounds to converge to the
limiting value of \(\pi\).

\(1000000\) & \(3.1415926536\) & \(3.1415926536\) \\
\end{longtable}

The upper and lower bounds are equal up to ten decimal digits when
\(n = 10^{6}\), and we might declare the problem of estimating pi
solved. But in the time of Archimedes, trigonometry was not known; only
geometry was. Moreover, the decimal system and calculators were also in
the future. We now have to backtrack and attempt to retrace the steps
Archimedes used to estimate \(\pi\).

\subsubsection{Trigonometry and half
angles}\label{trigonometry-and-half-angles}

But before we leave trigonometry altogether, let us explore how a
recurrence relation may be established among successive estimates of
\(c(n)\) and \(C(n)\) when \(n\) is doubled.

Once we have calculated, say, \(c(6)\), ideally we would like to
calculate \(c(12)\) using the estimate of \(c(6)\). This process of
chaining successive results is called
\href{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recursion-2/}{recursion}
and is vital in developing efficient algorithms.

angles in terms of the full angle} {[}\citeproc{ref-half-angle}{1}{]}
helps relate the successive values of \(\theta\).

We now introduce a slight change in notation. Since our focus is on side
doubling and angle halving, we introduce a subscript \(k\) to denote the
number of doublings/halvings. We start with \(k = 0\) denoting no
doubling, which is the base case, with \(n = n_{0} = 6\). After that,
\(k\) doublings are denoted by \(2^{k}\).
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:base-case}{
\begin{aligned}
k &= 0\\
n &= n_{0}\\
\theta_{0} &= \tfrac{\pi}{n_{0}}\\
n_{k} &= 2^{k}n_{0}\\
\theta_{k} &= \theta(n_{k})\\
&= \theta(2^{k}n_{0})\\
&= \tfrac{\pi}{2^{k}n_{0}}\\ 
&= \tfrac{\theta_{0}}{2^k}.\\
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

In our case, for \(k\geq 1\), the half-angle formulae are:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:trig-half-angle}{\begin{aligned}
\sin\tfrac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k}} %
&= \sqrt{\left[\frac{1-\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}{2}\right]} %
&= \left[\frac{1-\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}{2}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
%
\cos\tfrac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k}} %
&= \sqrt{\left[\frac{1+\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}{2}\right]} %
&= \left[\frac{1+\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}{2}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
%
\tan\tfrac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k}} %
&= \sqrt{\left[\frac{1-\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}{1+\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}\right]} %
&= \left[\frac{1-\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}{1+\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

Once we have the base case for the regular hexagon, we can relate
successive angles and their sines and tans via \cref{eq:trig-half-angle}
and descend that binary staircase, according to
\cref{eq:base-case,eq:trig-half-angle,eq:staircase}:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:staircase}{
\begin{aligned}
n_{k}\sin\theta_{k} &= 2^{k}n_{0}\sin\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k}}\\
&= 2^{k}n_{0}\left[\frac{1-\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}{2}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
n_{k}\tan\theta_{k} &= 2^{k}n_{0}\tan\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k}}\\
&= \left[\frac{1-\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}{1+\cos\left[\frac{\theta_{0}}{2^{k-1}}\right]}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation} The recurrence relation linking \(\theta_{k}\) to
\(\theta_{k-1}\) has now been established. We tabulate below the values
for \(n_{0} = 6\) and \(\theta = \theta_{0} = \frac{180°}{6} = 30°\)
derived from the half-angle formulae:

This has been a digression because these techniques were not available
to Archimedes in his day. I have added it for completeness, and to
demonstrate the use of recurrence relations with the trigonometric
approach {[}\citeproc{ref-damini-dhar-2020}{2}{]}.

We now return to the main theme of how Archimedes used geometry to
relate current values to previous values.

\subsubsection{The angle bisector
theorem}\label{the-angle-bisector-theorem}

Without using the half-angle formulae of trigonometry, how can we
successively obtain expressions for the values of \(c(n)\) and \(C(n)\)
as we halve the angles and double the sides each time? We have to rely
on something called the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_bisector_theorem}{angle
bisector theorem} from geometry. This was something Archimedes already
knew.

This derivation might seem tedious, but it is closer to what Archimedes
did in order to establish the recurrence relation that tied the current
value to the previous value.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includesvg[width=0.7\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/angle-bisector.svg}
\caption{The angle bisector theorem. The relative lengths of the two
segments that a triangle's side is divided into by a line that bisects
the opposite angle equals the relative lengths of the other two sides of
the triangle, as shown on the diagram.}\label{fig:angle-bisector}
\end{figure}

Referring to \cref{fig:angle-bisector}, if the line \(OC\) bisects the
angle \(BOA\), then the base \(AB\) is divided in the same ratio as the
corresponding sides. This means
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:angle-bisector}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{AO}{OB} &= \frac{AC}{CB} \mbox{ which in turn means that }\\
\frac{a}{b} &= \frac{p}{q}\\
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

Before we can apply this to the regular hexagons we need to become aware
of what I call the thirty, sixty, ninety triangle, which is considered
next.

\subsubsection{The thirty, sixty, ninety right
triangle}\label{the-thirty-sixty-ninety-right-triangle}

Archimedes applied the principle ``of starting from the known'' to
initiate his algorithm using a \emph{regular hexagon}, which is a mosaic
of six juxtaposed equilateral triangles. We know from symmetry that each
angle of an equilateral triangle is \(60°\). When an equilateral
triangle is bisected, we get two right-angled triangles with angles of
thirty and sixty degrees, as shown in \cref{fig:thirty-sixty}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includesvg[width=0.4\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/thirty-sixty.svg}
\caption{This right-angled, obtained by bisecting an equilateral
triangle, must be familiar to all school students. These
lengths---obtainable from symmetry and the theorem of
Pythagoras---allowed Archimedes to start off his process for estimating
\(\pi\).}\label{fig:thirty-sixty}
\end{figure}

The inscribed hexagon, within a circle of radius one unit, also has a
side of one unit. Thus, the hypotenuse of the circle \(OAP\) in
\cref{fig:thirty-sixty} has unit length. Moreover, the base \(OP\),
resulting from a bisected side, has a length of half a unit. By applying
the theorem of Pythagoras, the third side, \(AP\) is
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:triangle}{
\sqrt{1^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
}\end{equation}

The next thing Archimedes needed and knew how to do was to compute
\(\sqrt{3}\) which figures in \cref{eq:triangle}. Finding square roots
is a tedious process, not unlike long division, and prone to human
error. The patience and doggedness of Archimedes that must have gone
into the process is astounding.

\subsubsection{Extracting square roots by
hand}\label{extracting-square-roots-by-hand}

Archimedes must have known how to extract square roots by hand. Perhaps,
he used one of the methods described in my blog
\href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/how-are-numbers-built}{``How
Are Numbers Built?''}. He should have known the value of \(\sqrt{3}\) as
a rational fraction. With remarkable accuracy, he stated that:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:sqrt3}{\sqrt{3} \approx \frac{265}{153} \approx 1.732.
}\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Numerical results}\label{numerical-results}

WHERE TO PUT THIS?

Evaluating the bounds given in \cref{tbl:variables} and
\cref{eq:squeeze} by setting \(r = 1\), \(n = 6\), and
\(\theta = \frac{180}{n} = 30°\)\footnote{Rather than use radians with
  \(\pi\) entering the proceedings, I decided to stick with degrees as
  units to avoid confusion. If one uses power series to probe further,
  of course, radians are called for.} gives us these values:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:triple-6}{
\begin{aligned}
C_i &= 2n\sin\theta r = 12(\sin 30°) = 12(0.5) &= 6.0000.\\
C &= 2\pi r &= 6.2381.\\
C_c &= 2n\tan\theta r = 12(\tan 30°) = 12\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right) = 4\sqrt{3} &\approx 6.9282.\\
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

Archimedes doubled \(n\) four times to compute values for regular
polygons with \(12\), \(24\), \(48\), and \(96\) sides. For his last
calculation with \(n = 96\) and
\(\theta = \tfrac{180}{96}° \approx 1.875°\), we have:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:triple-96}{
\begin{aligned}
C_i &= 2n\sin\theta r = 2(96)\sin{1.875°} \approx 192(0.0327) &\approx 6.2820.\\
C &= 2\pi r &= 6.2381.\\
C_c &= 2n\tan\theta r = 2(96)\tan{1.875°} \approx 192(0.0327) &\approx 6.2854.\\
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

Note that in the case of 96 sides, we have a \emph{very small angle}
\(\theta\) whose \(\sin\) and \(\tan\) are almost equal. This is what
gives us tight bounds on the estimate of \(\pi\). If you know the power
series for \(\sin\theta\) and \(\tan\theta\), you will appreciate even
better how the value of \(\pi\) is trapped and squeezed between these
two rather close limits.

Remember \cref{eq:triple-96} because it helps us to estimate lower and
upper bounds for the value of the circumference. Archimedes's
application of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem}{squeeze theorem}
nineteen centuries before the calculus was invented is illustrated in
the series of figures,
\cref{fig:six-gon,fig:twelve-gon,fig:twenty-four-gon,fig:forty-eight-gon,fig:ninety-six-gon}.

\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sanity_check}{Sanity check}: Does
\(2\pi = 6.2820\), from a calculator, lie within the bounds of
\cref{eq:triple-96}? Yes, indeed, and we are
\href{https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/be-home-and-dry}{home
and dry}.

Second sanity check: When \(n\) is very large, we expect
\(n\sin\frac{180°}{n}\) to be closer and closer to the true value.
Setting \(n = 10^6\) and evaluating on a calculator we get
\(10^6\sin\frac{180°}{10^6} = 3.14159\) which is reassuring. This deep
connection between the circle and the trigonometric functions also
explains why they are sometimes called the \emph{circular functions}.
Indeed, the values \(n\sin\frac{\pi}{n}\) and \(n\sin\tan{\pi}{n}\) both
converge to \(\pi\) for very large \(n\). The interested reader should
plot these two curves.

WHERE SHOULD THIS GO?

Imagine the mathematical
\href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/fortitude-2019-11-21}{fortitude}
of Archimedes to
\href{https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/plough-on}{plough
on}---without algebra or trigonometry or the decimal number system---to
establish the value of \(\pi\).

Before we consider numerical results, there are two aspects of the
problem and the approach taken by Archimedes that I wish to discuss.

\subsubsection{Recursion and Iteration}\label{recursion-and-iteration}

Archimedes started with regular hexagons and successively \emph{doubled}
the number of sides, until he had the circle closely sandwiched between
two 96-gons---one circumscribe; the other inscribed. Successively
doubling or halving is a fast-converging technique used in numerical
estimation, called the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method}{bisection method},
that is applied to solving a variety of problems. That Archimedes was
aware of it shows how far ahead of his time his thinking was.

When he moved from \(n=6\) to \(n = 12\) sides, how did Archimedes
estimate the respective perimeters without the aid of trigonometry? He
used geometry and the Pythagorean theorem,
\href{https://nonagon.org/ExLibris/archimedes-pi}{as described here
online} {[}\citeproc{ref-bertrand2014}{3}{]} to obtain
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation}{recurrence
relations} that gave the current result from the previous one.

For an English translation of the book \emph{Measurement of a Circle} by
Archimedes \href{auxiliary/Archimedes-Circle.pdf}{click on this link}.
It is the original source material from the man himself, and will give
you a sense of completeness in your understanding of his method.

He repeatedly calculated rational approximations to \(\pi\) until he was
satisfied with the accuracy. The principle of the method is clearly seen
in
\cref{fig:six-gon,fig:twelve-gon,fig:twenty-four-gon,fig:forty-eight-gon,fig:ninety-six-gon}.

\caption{The estimate for \(\pi\) lies between

how the circumference of the circle approaches the perimeter of the
inscribed and circumscribed heaxgons to the point of being
indistinguishable from them. \emph{The final estimate of Archimedes was
\(\frac{223}{71} < \pi < \frac{22}{7}\).}}\label{fig:ninety-six-gon}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Is π really 22/7?}\label{is-ux3c0-really-227}

The answer is a qualified ``Yes and no''. Because \(\pi\) is irrational,
it cannot be expressed precisely in a finite number of digits.
Consequently, we use rational approximations, or a decimal
representation at the desired accuracy for \(\pi\). Thanks to
Archimedes, \(\frac{22}{7}\) is a serviceable overestimate for \(\pi\)
that has survived for centuries.

\subsection{A closer look at π as a
number}\label{a-closer-look-at-ux3c0-as-a-number}

Pi is both an
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number}{irrational} and a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number}{transcendental}
number. Let us see what each of these
\href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appellation}{appelations}
mean.

Recurring decimals.

\subsection{To explore further}\label{to-explore-further}

A well-written, accessible article on how Archimedes estimated that
\(\pi\) is approximately \(\frac{22}{7}\) is available online:
\href{https://publications.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/3356/1/02-DaminiAndAbhishek_PiIs22By7_Final.pdf}{``How
Archimedes showed that pi is approximately 22 by 7''}. I urge you to
read it.\footnote{This article is all the more remarkable because its
  first author is a Grade 8 student: proof that deep mathematics is not
  beyond the school student.} You will then appreciate for yourselves
how arduous the process must have been in an age without the benefit of:
\#. Trigonometry; he used the theorem of pythagors instead; \#. Algebra;
he used geometry and the ratios of the lengths of well-known triangles;
\#. Decimal numbers for division; he used fractions instead; square
roots by hand; similar and congruent figures; bisection theorems;
exhaustion methods

In
\cref{fig:six-gon,fig:twelve-gon,fig:twenty-four-gon,fig:forty-eight-gon,fig:ninety-six-gon}
below, which illustrate the approach Archimedes took to estimate
\(\pi\), we see very clearly that the perimeter of the \emph{inscribed
polygon} \(c_n\) and the perimeter of the \emph{circumscribed polygon}
\(C_n\) represent respectively the \emph{lower bound} and \emph{upper
bound} of the estimated value of \(\pi\). As the number of sides, \(n\),
of the polygon increases, the estimates become increasingly accurate.
