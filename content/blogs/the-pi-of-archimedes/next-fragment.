In [@fig:six-gon;@fig:twelve-gon;@fig:twenty-four-gon;@fig:forty-eight-gon;@fig:ninety-six-gon] below, which illustrate the approach Archimedes took to estimate $\pi$, we see very clearly that the perimeter of the _inscribed polygon_ $c(n))$ and the perimeter of the _circumscribed polygon_ $C(n)$ represent respectively the _lower bound_ and _upper bound_ of the estimated value of $\pi$. As the number of sides, $n$, of the polygon increases, these estimates converge and become increasingly accurate as shown in [@fig:plot]


## A closer look at π as a number

Pi is both an [irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number) and a [transcendental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number) number. Let us see what each of these [appelations](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appellation) mean.
