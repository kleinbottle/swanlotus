In a [recent blog](https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/a-foray-into-rust-euler-one) I chronicled my efforts at solving the [Project Euler Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) using the programming language `Rust`. At the conclusion of the blog, I was less enthusiastic about `Rust` than I was at the start.

Was there another relatively new programming language that was better suited to my temperament and that held promise to become mainstream? I thought of [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/) which has an impressive pedigree of academics from reputed institutions behind its invention.

I also happened to watch recently [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgcwvrGGFww) by an academic from India, [Professor Sourish Das](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/fac-profile.php?id=sourish), belonging to [the reputed Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/), in which he pitched for Julia as _the_ programming language of the future for the field of [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science). The good professor compared Julia with current mainstream languages used in Data Science, and explained with convincing facts why he was batting for `Julia` to be the leader in a few years.

## Solving Project Euler Problem One

To compare apples with apples, I thought I would first try to solve Euler Problem 1 using Julia.

The first thing I looked for was vectorization and the use of the simple `start:step:end` syntax that was familiar to me from [Octave](https://octave.org/). I searched for vectors and ranges and landed up [here](https://docs.juliahub.com/CalculusWithJulia/AZHbv/0.0.5/precalc/ranges.html)
