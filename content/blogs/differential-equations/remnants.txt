Acceleration: magnitude/direction
Force
Momentum: mv product of mass and velocity and therefore a vector
F = d/dt(mv)
What happens if m changes with velocity: Relativity. Cannot apply this equation
Energy: scalar 1/2mv2
F = ma = d/dt(mv) = md/dt(v) = ma
F = mdv/dt = ma

Idea of a function must be clarified.

Where time and or space vary

DEs model physical phenomena where time and space vary along with possibly other variables.

Linear differential equations with constant coefficients

### Examples of LDEs in real life

Spring under displacement

Wave motion

Simple pendulum

Electric circuits
