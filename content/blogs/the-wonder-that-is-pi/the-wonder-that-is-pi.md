summary: "This blog began life more than two decades ago, as part of a series of lectures I delivered to very bright first-year engineering students at an Australian university.

The number π (pronounced 'pie') has been recognized from time immemorial because its physical significance can be grasped easily: it is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. But who would have thought that such an innocent ratio would exercise such endless fascination because of the complexities enfolded into it?

Not surprisingly, some students I met recently wanted to know more about π. Accordingly, I have refreshed and revised my original presentation to better accord with the form and substance of a blog. The online references have also been updated to keep up with a rapidly changing Web."

## Circumference, diameter and π

The straight line or [geodesic](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Geodesic.html) is the shortest distance between any two points on a plane, sphere, or other space. The circle is the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics)) traversed by a moving point that is [equidistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistant) from another fixed point on a two-dimensional plane. It is the most [symmetrical](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Symmetry.html) figure on the plane. The [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter) is the name given both to any straight line passing through the centre of the circle---intersecting it at two points---as well as to its length. When we divide the [perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter) of circle, more properly called its [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference), $C$, by its diameter, $d$, we get the enigmatic constant  $\pi$, which has a value between $3.141$ and $3.142$: 
$$
\frac{C}{d} = \pi.
$${#eq:pi-Cd}
The diameter $d$ is twice the radius $r$, and substituting for $d$ into @eq:pi-Cd, we get the well-known school formula:
$$
C = \pi d = 2\pi r \approx 2\left[\frac{22}{7}\right]r \approx 6.28r.
$${#eq:two-pi-r}
Note, however, that $\pi$ is _not exactly equal_ to $\frac{22}{7}$. This value is a convenient _rational fraction approximation_ for $\pi$ that serves well in elementary contexts.^[See ["A tale of two measures: degrees and radians"](https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/a-tale-of-two-measures-degrees-and-radians).]

You might reasonably wonder whether the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of _any_ circle is _always_ $\pi$. The answer is "Yes", because _all circles are similar_. The ratios of corresponding lengths of similar figures are equal. This idea is also covered in my blog ["A tale of two measures: degrees and radians"](https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/a-tale-of-two-measures-degrees-and-radians).

The symbol [$\pi$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) is the lowercase version of the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet. For the history of its use in mathematics, see [adoption of the symbol π in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Adoption_of_the_symbol_%CF%80).

@fig:pi-circle shows the relationships in @eq:pi-Cd and @eq:two-pi-r pictorially. The circumference of a circle is about 6.28 times its radius. Why this should be so is a secret, a mystery of Nature.

## A closer look at π

Pi is both an [irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number) and a [transcendental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number) number. Let us see what each of these [appelations](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appellation) mean.

## How did we arrive at π = 22/7?

22/7 = 3.142857 142857 142857 (recurring decimal)
