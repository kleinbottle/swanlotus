summary: "This blog began life more than two decades ago as part of a series of lectures I delivered to very bright first-year engineering students at an Australian university.

The number π (pronounced like 'pie') has been recognized from time immemorial because its physical significance can be grasped easily: it is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. But who would have thought that such an innocent ratio would exercise such endless fascination because of the complexities enfolded into it?

Not surprisingly, some students I met recently wanted to know more about π. Accordingly, I have refreshed and revised my original presentation to better accord with the form and substance of a blog. The online references have also been updated to keep up with a rapidly changing Web."

## Circumference, diamater and pi

The straight line and circle are arguably among the simplest of geometrical objects. The circle is the most [symmetrical](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Symmetry.html) figure on the two-dimensional plane while the straight line is the shortest distance between any two points on it. The [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter) is both the straight line passing through the centre of the circle, intersecting it at two points, and its length. Yet, when we divide the [perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter) of circle, more properly called its [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference), $C$, by the diameter, $d$, we get the enigmatic number $\pi$: 
$$
\frac{C}{d} = \pi.
$${#eq:pidef}
@fig:circle shows this relationship pictorially.
