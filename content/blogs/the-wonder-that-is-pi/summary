summary: "This blog began life more than two decades ago as apart of a series of lectures I delivered to very bright first-year engineering students at an Australian university. The number Ï€ (pronounced like 'pie') has been recognized from time immemorial because its physical significance can be grasped easily: it is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. But who would have thought that such an innocent ratio would exercise such endless fascination because of the complexities enfolded into it? Not surprisingly, some students I met recently wanted to know more about it. Accordingly, I have refreshed my original presentation to better accord with the form and substance of a blog. The online references have also been updated to keep up with a rapidly changing Web."
