This blog began life more than two decades ago, as part of a series of
lectures I delivered to very bright first-year engineering students at
an Australian university.

The number \(\pi\) (pronounced ``pie'') has been recognized from time
immemorial because its physical significance can be grasped easily: it
is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. But who
would have thought that such an innocent ratio would exercise such
endless fascination because of the complexities enfolded into it?

Not surprisingly, some students I met recently wanted to know more about
\(\pi\). Accordingly, I have substantially recast and refreshed my
original presentation to better accord with the form and substance of a
blog. The online references have also been updated to keep up with a
rapidly changing Web.

If there are any errors or omissions, please
\href{mailto:feedback.swanlotus@gmail.com}{email} me your feedback.

\subsection{Circumference, diameter, and
π}\label{circumference-diameter-and-ux3c0}

The straight line or
\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Geodesic.html}{geodesic} is the
shortest distance between any two points on a plane, sphere, or other
space. The circle is the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics)}{locus}
traversed by a moving point that is
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistant}{equidistant} from
another fixed point on a two-dimensional plane. It is the most
\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Symmetry.html}{symmetrical} figure
on the plane. The
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter}{diameter} is the name
given both to any straight line passing through the centre of the
circle---intersecting it at two points---as well as to its length. When
we divide the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter}{perimeter}
of circle, more properly called its
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference}{circumference},
\(C\), by its diameter, \(d\), we get the enigmatic constant \(\pi\),
which has a value between \(3.141\) and \(3.142\):
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:pi-Cd}{
\frac{C}{d} = \pi.
}\end{equation} The diameter \(d\) is twice the radius \(r\), and
substituting for \(d\) into \cref{eq:pi-Cd}, we get the well-known
school formula: \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:two-pi-r}{
C = \pi d = 2\pi r \approx 2\left[\frac{22}{7}\right]r \approx 6.28r.
}\end{equation} Note, however, that \(\pi\) is \emph{not exactly equal}
to \(\frac{22}{7}\). This value is a convenient \emph{rational fraction
approximation} for \(\pi\) that serves well in elementary
contexts.\footnote{See
  \href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/a-tale-of-two-measures-degrees-and-radians}{``A
  tale of two measures: degrees and radians''}.}

You might reasonably wonder whether the ratio of the circumference to
the diameter of \emph{any} circle is \emph{always} \(\pi\). The answer
is ``Yes'', because \emph{all circles are similar}. The ratios of
corresponding lengths of similar figures are equal. This idea is also
covered in my blog
\href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/a-tale-of-two-measures-degrees-and-radians}{``A
tale of two measures: degrees and radians''}.

The symbol \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi}{\(\pi\)} is the
lowercase version of the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet. For the
history of its use in mathematics, see
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi\#Adoption_of_the_symbol_\%CF\%80}{adoption
of the symbol π in Wikipedia}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includesvg[width=0.7\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/C-over-d.svg}
\caption{The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of \emph{any}
circle is \(\pi\).}\label{fig:pi-circle}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:pi-circle} shows the relationships in \cref{eq:pi-Cd} and
\cref{eq:two-pi-r} pictorially. The circumference of a circle is about
6.28 times its radius. Why this should be so is a secret, a mystery of
Nature.

\subsection{Is π really equal to
22/7?}\label{is-ux3c0-really-equal-to-227}

Is \(\pi\) really equal to \(\frac{22}{7}\), as it has been drummed into
our heads at school? A wonderfully revealing story lies behind this
mysterious relationship, and it is due to the
\href{https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/labours}{labours}
of one man, in the days when calculators could not be dreamed of, and
when neither the decimal system of numbers nor trigonometry were known.
That is the story we look at next.

\subsection{Archimedes of Syracuse}\label{archimedes-of-syracuse}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes}{Archimedes of Syracuse}
(Ἀρχιμήδης, 287--212 BCE) was a
\href{https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/polymath\#:~:text=Definitions\%20of\%20polymath,of\%20great\%20and\%20varied\%20learning}{polymath}
and genius of the ancient world. He was one of the greatest
mathematicians the world has ever known. By today's standards, he would
be called a mathematician, physicist, engineer, and astronomer,
\href{https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/all-rolled-into-one}{all
rolled into one}. He is perhaps most famous for running out of his
bathtub naked exclaiming
\href{https://www.dictionary.com/browse/eureka}{``Eureka''} (Greek for
``I have found it'') oblivious of those around him. The principle that
he had then discovered---that the upthrust on a body submerged in a
fluid is equal to the weight of fluid displaced---is known as
\href{https://www.britannica.com/science/Archimedes-principle}{Archimedes'
Principle}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/Domenico-Fetti_Archimedes_1620.jpg}
\caption{Archimedes of Syracuse.}\label{fig:archimedes}
\end{figure}

Among the many accomplishments of Archimedes is his method for
estimating \(\pi\), which was the best approximation for almost 1900
years. What is even more remarkable is that Archimedes made his
discovery without the benefit of either trigonometry or decimal
(positional) notation. His method is also an excellent geometrical
illustration of the idea of a limit, with which he was doubtless
familiar. It is known that Archimedes was familiar with what we now know
as integral calculus, and it is possible that he may have anticipated
differential calculus as well.

\subsubsection{The algorithm as a
foundation}\label{the-algorithm-as-a-foundation}

The method that Archimedes used is instructive because it is a synthesis
of several principles by which the greatest human minds have furthered
scientific progress over time. The abstract principles that Archimedes
used were these:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Start with the known and progress to the unknown;
\item
  Devise a method of increasing the accuracy of the estimate and iterate
  over it;
\item
  Stop when the desired accuracy is reached.
\end{enumerate}

These three principles constitute what is known as an
\href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm}{algorithm}.
Once such a systematic framework has been put in place, it can be
applied in many research domains to aid rapid scientific progress.

\subsubsection{Of polygons and circles}\label{of-polygons-and-circles}

Archimedes realized that when a circle is inscribed by a regular polygon
with \(n\) sides and circumscribed by a regular polygon with the same
\(n\) sides, the circumference of the circle must lie between the
perimeter of the inscribed polygon (limit from below) and the
circumscribed polygon (limit from above).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includesvg[width=0.7\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/two-limits.svg}
\caption{The length of the circle is bounded from below by the inscribed
heagon in maroon and bounded from above by the inscribed hexagon in
midnight blue. The circumference of the circle must lie bween the
perimeters of these two hexagons.}\label{fig:bounds}
\end{figure}

This visually obvious fact is the first instance of ``starting with the
known.''

The second application of the same principle was his decision to
initiate his algorithm using a regular hexagon, which is a mosaic of six
juxtaposed equilateral triangles. We know from symmetry that each angle
of an equilateral triangle is \(60°\). When an equilateral triangle is
bisected, we get two right angled triangles with angles of thirty and
sixty degrees, as shown in \cref{fig:thirty-sixty}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includesvg[width=0.7\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/thirty-sixty.svg}
\caption{This right-angled, obtained by bisecting an equilateral
triangle, must be familiar to all school students. These
lengths---obtainable from symmetry and the theorem of
Pythagoras---allowed Archimedes to start off his process for estimating
\(\pi\).}\label{fig:thirty-sixty}
\end{figure}

Archimedes started with regular hexagons and successively doubled the
number of sides until he had the circle sandwiched between two 96-gons.
The principle of the method is clearly seen in
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:archi}.

He devised an ingenious method for estimating the circumference of a
circle. It was not based on using a length of string, superimposing it
on a circle, and getting an estimate. He used a sophisticated algorithm
that allowed him to obtain successively more accurate values for the
circumference of a circle, and therefore of \(\pi\).

A well-written, accessible article on how Archimedes estimated that
\(\pi\) is approximately \(\frac{22}{7}\) is available online:
\href{https://publications.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/3356/1/02-DaminiAndAbhishek_PiIs22By7_Final.pdf}{``How
Archimedes showed that pi is approximately 22 by 7''}. I urge you to
read it.\footnote{This article is all the more remarkable because its
  first author is a Grade 8 student: proof that deep mathematics is not
  beyond the school student.} You will then appreciate for yourselves
how arduous the process must have been in an age without the benefit of:
\#. Trigonometry; he used the theorem of pythagors instead; \#. Algebra;
he used geometry and the ratios of the lengths of well-known triangles;
\#. Decimal numbers for division; he used fractions instead;

In the series \cref{fig:six} to \cref{fig:forty-eight} below, which
illustrate the approach Archimedes took to estimate \(\pi\), we see very
clearly that the perimeter of the \emph{inscribed polygon} \(c_n\) and
the perimeter of the \emph{circumscribed polygon} \(C_n\) represent
respectively the \emph{lower bound} and \emph{upper bound} of the
estimated value of \(\pi\). As the number of sides, \(n\), of the
polygon increases, the estimates become increasingly accurate.

Archimedes devised his ingenious \emph{squeeze} method for computing the
upper and lower bounds of the perimeter of a circle by computing instead
the perimeters of the polygons that inscribe and circumscribe the
circle. The approximations become more accurate as the number of sides,
\(n\), of the polygon is increased.
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qdnyw5Eb_Y}{This YouTube
presentation} might help you understand the algorithm of Archimedes
better, but remember that he did not have trigonometry to sid hm.
