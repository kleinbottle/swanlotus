### Pandoc, Word, and the reference document

Seven told Sol that the `.docx` format of Word was closed and proprietary. Pandoc had been able to breach that fortress through a loophole called a [reference document](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html). The trick is to:

#.  Generate a custom reference reference document `custom-reference.docx` so:

```bash
pandoc -o custom-reference.docx --print-default-data-file reference.docx
```
#.  Open `custom-reference.docx` in Word and click on the `Styles Pane`.
#.  Create new character styles for Font Awesome in all three flavours: Regular, Solid, and Brands.
#.  Set the names of the new styles as `FontAwesomeRegular`, `FontAwesomeSolid`, and `FontAwesomeBrands`.
#.  Set the style type to `character` and the `Style based on` to `Default Paragraph Font`.
#.  Choose the fonts from the `Font` dropdown to accord with the three styles.
