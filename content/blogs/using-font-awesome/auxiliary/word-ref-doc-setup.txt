Before using this plugin you would need to satisfy the following prerequisites:

1. First download the Font Awesome Desktop fonts from [Font Awesome Download](https://fontawesome.com/download) and install them on your computer.

1. Then create a docx reference document by using the following command:


bash
    pandoc -o custom-reference.docx --print-default-data-file reference.docx


1. Next open the custom-reference.docx file in Microsoft Word and double click on the Styles Pane as annotated in the screenshot below:

    ![Styles Pane in Microsoft Word](images/styles-pane.png)

1. Then click on the _New Style_ button.

    ![New Style button](images/new-style.png)

1. In the _Create New Style_ dialog set the name of the style to _FontAwesomeRegular_.

    N.B. If you name the style something else the filter will not function correctly.

1. Ensure that the _Style type_ field is set to _Character_.

1. Ensure that the _Style based on_ field is set to _Default Paragraph Font_.

1. Then choose the font for the Font Awesome regular icons by choosing the appropriate font and click _OK_.

    For the free version of Font Awesome the font name for the regular icons would be similar to _Font Awesome 6 Free Regular_.

    The annotated figure below shows all the settings described above:

    The color of the icon matches the font color of the text in the Word document. You may optionally choose a color for the icons but this will change the color for all Font Awesome regular icons.

1. Next add the text _FontAwesomeRegular_ to the end of the custom-reference.docx reference document.

1. Then, highlight the text you added above and scroll down the Styles Pane until you find the _FontAwesomeRegular_ style. Then click on it to set the text to that style.

1. Finally, save the custom-reference.docx reference document.

1. If you are using the Font Awesome Solid or Font Awesome Brands icons as well repeat steps 3 to 11.

    N.B. Please make sure that the Font Awesome Solid style is named _FontAwesomeSolid_, and the Font Awesome Brands style is named _FontAwesomeBrands_.

    Also ensure that the correct font is selected.

## Usage

The lua filter looks for a custom style being appended to the Font Awesome icons in your markdown source document.

1. First your regular icons  should be modified to look like []{.fa-regular}.

1. Your solid icons  will need to be modified to look like []{.fa-solid}.

1. Brands icons set like  will need to look like this []{.fa-brands}.

1. Once you have made the above changes in your markdown run the following command:


bash
    pandoc -f markdown -t docx --reference-doc custom-reference.docx --lua-filter handle-font-awesome-docx.lua -o sample.docx sample.md


You should now see the Font Awesome icons showing up in the resulting Word document.
