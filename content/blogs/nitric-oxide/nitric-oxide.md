Nitric oxide is a simple chemical compountd that has generated great interest and research effort in the scramble to cope with COVID-19. It promises prophylaxis and possibly therapy against this novel plague.

## Nitric oxide: a brief history

Nitric oxide was discovered by [Joseph Priestly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley) about 250 years ago in 1772. He called it "nitrous air". It is a molecule consisting of a single atom of nitrogen and a single atom of oxygen.

Given that the air we breathe is 78% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, one would think that this compound would be a ubiquitous entity. But that is not so. It has lain hidden in plain sight for almost two centuries until the elucidation of its biological significance brought it into prominence.
