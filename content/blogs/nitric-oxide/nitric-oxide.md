Nitric oxide is a simple chemical compound that has generated great interest and research effort in the scramble to cope with COVID-19. It promises prophylaxis and possibly therapy against this novel plague.

## Nitric oxide, NO: a brief history

[Nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide) was discovered by [Joseph Priestly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley) about 250 years ago in 1772. He called it "nitrous air". It is a molecule consisting of a single atom of nitrogen and a single atom of oxygen, and is preferably called nitogen monoxide, given the plethora opf oxides of nitrogen.

Note that nitrogen, with atomic number 7, and oxygen, with atomic number 8, are next-door neighbours in the [periodic table](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/). Not only that, they were discovered in 1772 and 1774 respectively, just two years apart.

Given that the air we breathe is approximately 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, one would think that this simple compound of nitrogen and oxygen would be a well-known entity. But that is not so.

It has lain hidden in plain sight for almost two centuries---being thought of as little more than an atmospheric pollutant---until the elucidation of its biological significance in the 1980s brought it into greater prominence.

## The chemical relatives of nitric oxide

The chemical relatives of nitric oxide have often eclipsed it in significance, because, historically, they have been better studied, and better applied or coped with in everyday life.

### Nitrous oxide, N~2~O
 
_Nitrous_ oxide, N~2~O, is often confounded with _nitric_ oxide, NO. Given its propensity to excite mirth when inhaled, [Sir Humphry Davy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy) christened nitrous oxide as "laughing gas". It is used as an anaesthetic, and as a rocket propellant, among other applications.

### Nitrogen dioxide, NO~2~

Nitrogen dioxide, NO~2~, is the villain of the piece. It is a toxic, brown, acrid gas and a major atmospheric pollutant that contributes to [photochemical smog](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Photochemical_smog). But it also has its uses as an intermediate in the production of nitric acid which is used for fertilizers, and as rocket fuel, among others.

### Dinitrogen tetroxide, N~2~O~4~

Dinitrogen tetroxide, N~2~O~4~ is a [dimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry)) of nitrogen dioxide NO~2~, and not surprisingly, forms an equilibrium mixture with it. It has found application as a bleaching agent, as a rocket fuel, and in explosives.

### NO~$x$~

It should be clear by now that most of the chemical relatives of nitric oxide are powerful, toxic substances that can also pollute. Indeed the atmospherically polluting oxides of nitrogen have been lumped into a class and given the tongue-in-cheek chemical formula NO~$x$~ to refer to [oxides of nitrogen, specifically NO and NO~2~](http://www.apis.ac.uk/overview/pollutants/overview_nox.htm). Indeed, [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone), NO, and NO~2~ perform a dance of dynamic equilibrium that leads to severe air pollution.

### So, where does NO fit into all this?

In light of this, we may justifiably speculate that nitric oxide is also a polluting gas, perhaps with some toxicity, and we would not be entirely wrong in that characterization.

But NO is also profoundly significant biologically: so much so that the [Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for 1998](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1998/summary/) was awarded to a trio^[Robert F Furchgott, Louis J Ignarro, and Ferid Murad.] of researchers who triangulated on its physiological function as a signalling molecule in the cardiovascular system, and thereby opened the doors to greater scrutiny of this tiny molecule.

## Its rise to prominence

## Oxidation and reduction

If you remember your high school chemistry, you will recall _redox_ reactions in which a reducing agent and an oxidizing agent battle it out in the chemical flask until a colour change signals a truce. To generalize the concept of oxidation, whether or not oxygen was itself explicitly involved, the definitions given were:

#.  an oxidizing agent is an electron 

## Free radicals and anti-oxidants

A cursory scan of current popular health literature will tell you that a free radical is the marauding villain out to rob you of your youth and health while the good guys are the anti-oxidants who police your body to weed out the gangs of free radicals.

But are free-radicals oxidants or reducing agents?
