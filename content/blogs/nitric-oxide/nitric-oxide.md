Nitric oxide is a simple chemical compound that has generated great interest and research effort in the scramble to cope with COVID-19. It promises prophylaxis and possibly therapy against this novel plague.

## Nitric oxide, NO: a brief history

[Nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide) was discovered by [Joseph Priestly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley) about 250 years ago in 1772. He called it "nitrous air". It is a molecule consisting of a single atom of nitrogen and a single atom of oxygen. Given given the plethora of oxides of nitrogen, it is perhaps better referred to as _nitrogen monoxide_.

Note that nitrogen, with atomic number 7, and oxygen, with atomic number 8, are next-door neighbours in the [periodic table](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/). Not only that, they were discovered in 1772 and 1774 respectively, just two years apart.

The air we breathe is approximately 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. One would therefore think that this simple compound of nitrogen and oxygen would be a well-known, well-studied, and well-understood entity. But that is not so.

It has lain hidden in plain sight for almost two centuries---being thought of as little more than an atmospheric pollutant---until the elucidation of its biological significance in the 1980s brought it into greater prominence.

## The chemical relatives of nitric oxide

The chemical relatives of nitric oxide have often eclipsed it in significance historically, because they have been better studied, better understood, better applied, and better coped with in everyday life.

### Nitrous oxide, N~2~O
 
_Nitrous_ oxide, N~2~O, is often confounded with _nitric_ oxide, NO. Because of its propensity to excite mirth when inhaled, [Sir Humphry Davy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy) christened nitrous oxide as "laughing gas". It is used as a medical and dental anaesthetic, and as a rocket propellant, among other applications.

### Nitrogen dioxide, NO~2~

Nitrogen dioxide, NO~2~, is the villain of the piece. It is a toxic, brown, acrid gas and a major atmospheric pollutant that contributes to [photochemical smog](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Photochemical_smog). But it also has its uses as an intermediate in the production of nitric acid which is used for fertilizers, and as rocket fuel, among others. The fact that nitric oxide is unstable in air and undergoes spontaneous oxidation to nitrogen dioxide is most pertinent to our discussion here.

### Dinitrogen tetroxide, N~2~O~4~

Dinitrogen tetroxide, N~2~O~4~ is a [dimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry)) of nitrogen dioxide NO~2~, and not surprisingly, forms an equilibrium mixture with it. It has found application as a bleaching agent, as a rocket fuel, and in explosives.

### NO~$x$~

It should be clear by now that most of the chemical relatives of nitric oxide are powerful, toxic substances that can also pollute. Indeed the atmospherically polluting oxides of nitrogen have been lumped into a class and given the tongue-in-cheek chemical formula NO~$x$~ to refer to [oxides of nitrogen, specifically NO and NO~2~](http://www.apis.ac.uk/overview/pollutants/overview_nox.htm). Indeed, [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone), NO, and NO~2~ perform a dance of dynamic equilibrium that leads to [severe air pollution](https://www.aeroqual.com/meet-the-nitrogen-oxide-family).

### So, where does NO fit into all this?

In light of this, we may justifiably speculate that nitric oxide is a polluting and toxic gas, and we would not be entirely wrong in that characterization.

But nitric oxide is also profoundly significant biologically: so much so that the [Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for 1998](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1998/summary/) was awarded to a trio^[Robert F Furchgott, Louis J Ignarro, and Ferid Murad.] of researchers who triangulated on its physiological function as a signalling molecule in the cardiovascular system, and thereby opened the doors to greater scrutiny of this tiny molecule. Indeed, nitric oxide was named the ["Molecule of the Year"](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/258/5090/1861) by  _Science_ magazine in 1992.

## Poison or messenger?

So, what exactly is nitric oxide? Is it a poison or a messenger? Carbon is a next-door neighbour to nitrogen in the periodic table. Just as nitrogen has a monoxide, so does carbon. Carbon monoxide is toxic if inhaled and leads to death by the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. Likewise, nitrogen monoxide is toxic if inhaled in large quantities and can lead to death by the formation of [methemoglobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methemoglobin). But unlike carbon dioxide which is an active participant in the biochemistry of living systems, nitrogen dioxide is essentially toxic and a gas to be avoided. In a nutshell, nitric oxice is unstable and becomes nitrogen dioxide which is toxic. Therefore, inhaling nitric oxide is not soemthing you waoul want to do.

If everythig is so cut and dried, then why the buzz around nitric oxide and its multiple uses that led to its "Moleculeof the Year" award?

It all boils bown to the concentration or the fraction of inhlaed gas that is nitric oxide, and the dose or total amount taken in. If the values are above a threshold, the effect is toxic.

## An analogy from electrical engineering

An analogy from electrical engineering could help in this context. The same electrical power is used to heat in a kettle and to receive, decode, and play an audio signal in a radio. But the energy used is vastly different. On the case of the kettle, electricity is used for its "brute strength" while in the radio, the same electricity is used for its "finesse" in making manifest a minuscule signal, seemingly out of nowhere into an intelligible audible signal. The different orders of energy involved translate also into different effects.

In like fashion, large concentrations and doses of nitric oxide translate into macroscopically detectable toxocoty in the body whereas small concentrations and doses confer benefits.

## The biological role of nitric oxide

The [biological functions of nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_functions_of_nitric_oxide) are many and varied.

persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)

Nitric oxide has been found to be an important inter- and intracellular messenger in virtually every organ in the body. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a selective pulmonary vasodilator. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11728280/

exogenous and endogenous NO

## Signalling and vasoilation

## Cytotoxicity

Who is an enemy of my enemy is my friend.

Why does my friend not hurt me?

The free radical nitric oxide (NO) has emerged in recent years as a fundamental signaling molecule for the maintenance of homeostasis, as well as a potent cytotoxic effector involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human diseases. Although this paradoxical fate has generated confusion, separating the biological actions of NO on the basis of its physiologic chemistry provides a conceptual framework which helps to distinguish between the beneficial and toxic consequences of NO, and to envision potential therapeutic strategies for the future. Under normal conditions, NO produced in low concentration acts as a messenger and cytoprotective (antioxidant) factor, via direct interactions with transition metals and other free radicals. Alternatively, when the circumstances allow the formation of substantial amounts of NO and modify the cellular microenvironment (formation of the superoxide radical), the chemistry of NO will turn into indirect effects consecutive to the formation of dinitrogen trioxide and peroxynitrite. These "reactive nitrogen species" will, in turn, mediate both oxidative and nitrosative stresses, which form the basis of the cytotoxicity generally attributed to NO, relevant to the pathophysiology of inflammation, circulatory shock, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10807315/

## Oxidation and reduction

If you remember your high school chemistry, you will recall _redox_ reactions in which a reducing agent and an oxidizing agent battle it out in the chemical flask until a colour change signals a truce. To generalize the concept of oxidation, whether or not oxygen was itself explicitly involved, the definitions given were:

#.  an oxidizing agent is an electron 

## Free radicals and anti-oxidants

A cursory scan of current popular health literature will tell you that a free radical is the marauding villain out to rob you of your youth and health while the good guys are the anti-oxidants who police your body to weed out the gangs of free radicals.

But are free-radicals oxidants or reducing agents?
