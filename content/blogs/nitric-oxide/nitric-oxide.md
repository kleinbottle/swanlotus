Nitric oxide is a simple chemical compountd that has generated great interest and research effort in the scramble to cope with COVID-19. It promises prophylaxis and possibly therapy against this novel plague.

## Nitric oxide: a brief history

Nitric oxide was discovered by [Joseph Priestly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley) about 250 years ago in 1772. He called it "nitrous air". It is a molecule consisting of a single atom of nitrogen with atomic number 7 and a single atom of oxygen with atomic number 8.

Given that the air we breathe is approximately 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, one would think that this compound would be a ubiquitous entity. But that is not so. It has lain hidden in plain sight for almost two centuries until the elucidation of its biological significance in the 1980s brought it into prominence. Its chemical relatives often eclipsed it in significance.

### Other compounds of nitrogen and oxygen

It has been the fate of nitric oxide, NO, to be confounded with _nitrous_ oxide, N~2~O, christened by [Sir Humphry Davy]() as "laughing gas" given its propensity to excite mirth when inhaled. This gas found use an anaesthetic ...

A notorious chemical relative of nitric oxide is dinitrogen textroxide, N~2~O~4~, the toxic brown gas of chemical smog.

These compounds have been better studied because they are relatively stable compared to NO, which lasts only for XXX seconds before it changes composition to one of its better known relatives.

## Its rise to prominence

## Oxidation and reduction

If you remember your high school chemistry, you will recall _redox_ reactions in which a reducing agent and an oxidizing agent battle it out in the chemical flask until a colour change signals a truce. To generalize the concept of oxidation, whether or not oxygen was itself explicitly involved, the definitions given were:

#.  an oxidizing agent is an electron 

## Free radicals and anti-oxidants

A cursory scan of current popular health literature will tell you that a free radical is the marauding villain out to rob you of your youth and health while the good guys are the anti-oxidants who police your body to weed out the gangs of free radicals.

But are free-radicals oxidants or reducing agents?
