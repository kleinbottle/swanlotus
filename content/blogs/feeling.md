\synopsisbox{As a student, you want to excel in your studies by putting in the effort, and reaping success at the examinations. It is the mismatch between expectations and results that leads to the slippery slope of academic failure, which robs you of the exhilaration of success, and sometimes even of the desire to achieve.

Suppose someone told you that the world that you encounter externally is really a reflection of the world you harbour within yourself in your mind. And, moreover that frustration with failure, and the futility of all effort, may be flipped completely, simply by changing the internal worldview in your mind.

Sounds too good to be true? What have you to lose? Try the method outlined in this chapter and see for yourself. I have tried it and it has worked for me as long as I played by the rules of the game.

I am deliberately not disclosing any more, to whet your appetite all the more. There is a video presentation that delivers the theory and practice behind this almost magical method. Try it and enjoy a smoother ride to academic success.}

\section{From Dreams to Real Life}

The nursery rhyme tells us that life is but a dream. But, imagine if someone told you that your dream could become your life. Would you be inclined to believe that statement? If you are imbued with the scientific spirit, you would at the very least subject that assertion to experimental validation or refutation. If you are of that mind, read this chapter carefully, because it could be the single most important \textit{secret}---academic or otherwise---that you might encounter in your entire life.

\section{Books on "manifesting"}

There has been a steady procession of books on "manifesting" desires. "Manifesting" means exerting by doing  something to make your desires come true in the physical reality we inhabit.
