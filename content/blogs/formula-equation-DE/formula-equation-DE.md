An academic friend of mine casually asked me if I would write a blog demystifying the meanings and uses of three mathematical terms: formula, equation, and differential equation. I thought that this was spoken in jest, and let his request lie in a dusty corner of my mind, as a memento to his humour. Imagine my surprise when my friend accosted me again after a month and asked if I had put pen to paper to explain mathematical formulae etc.

"Surely, you cannot be serious, Algimantas", I said. Who would want to know something as fundamental as this?

"You would be astounded how many graduates who pass through the degree mill are illustrate about the _prupose_ behind these ideas," replied Algis. "As an added bonus, write your blog so that an elemntary school student, just going on to middle school, can understand it perfectly clearly."

Incredulously, I took up his challenge, and present this blog as my first effort. Any reader who finds it still muddy or murky as far as concepts are concerned, is cordially invited to [write to me](mailto:feedback.swanlotus@gmail.com).
