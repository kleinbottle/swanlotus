## Two or more perfectly timed events

[Serendipity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/serendipity), [fortuitousness](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fortuitousness), [happenstance](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/happenstance), good fortune, happy coincidence, [synchronicity](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/synchronicity). These diverse expressions describe the simultaneous occurrence of two or more desirable events that were not arranged beforehand. They seemed to happen on their own, by accident. Yet they were so appropriate and well-timed as to appear to be pre-arranged. We term this happy confluence a coincidence: co: meaning together; incidence: happening, i.e., a conjunction of two or more apparently unrelated events that was not planned, but perfect when they happened together.

Are there coincidences? Haven't we all had experiences of thinking about someone we have not seen for a long time, when suddenly the doorbell rings and there is that person standing at the door? Or perhaps he or she sent you a letter? Or better still sent you an email or spoke to you by VoIP or Instant Messaging on your PC? How do these unplanned incidents take place? Are they really the outcome of vanishingly small [joint probabilities](https://www.aiplusinfo.com/blog/joint-probability-definition-formula-examples/)? Or are they an uncanny result of some deeper force at work in our lives and in the larger universe?

This was the sort of philosophical conundrum that grated on Einstein's deeper-than-scientific sensibilities when he pondered the [probabilistic and utilitarian interpretation given to the Quantum Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/) by Niels Bohr and his disciples. Einstein famously said that he did not believe that God played dice with the world. To which the other retorted, "Stop telling God what to do".

So it was that Einstein postulated an exceedingly interesting experiment called
the EPR (Einstein Podolsky Rosen) experiment. In that thought experiment, two
photons that have been born together from the annihilation (mutual
dematerialization) of a positron (positively charged electron) and an electron
go their merry ways. Because they are twins, though, their destinies should be
linked (or correlated) according to the Quantum Theory. This means that if you
take the electron that has gone in one direction and tweak its ear so to speak,
the other electron will yell "Ouch", again in a manner of speaking. What is
more, this will happen *instantaneously*. Not at the speed of light, but at
once. However, according to Einstein, nothing can travel faster than light. So,
he said that the Quantum Theory must be wrong.

But you know what? The outcome Einstein predicted actually happens. Over the
last twenty years or so, teams or experimental physicists have proved that this
sort of effect does indeed happen: it is a form of "quantum spookiness". The
technical label for this is "entanglement". It is a consequence of the Quantum
Theory. A physicist called Bell proved this mathematically about twenty five
years after the EPR experiment was first suggested. The results of his paper
was stated simply as "Reality is non-local". What exactly does this mean?

Well it only apples to elementary particles that have been twinned. But this
quantum spookiness means that such particles are interconnected regardless of
how far, how long, and where they go. As usual, laboratories are now outdoing
each other in trying to apply this effect to encode messages, etc. If you want
to know more, read Amir Aczel's eminently accessible book "Entanglement"

But ponder the deeper philosophical implications of this experiment. What does
it mean on a larger scale or deeper level? It raises the possibility that there
may be a "something" that interconnects twinned particles. Can that something
also connect each and every one of us? Who knows? Reality seems stranger than
the imagination.

So what does this imply for coincidences? It may very well mean that there are
no coincidences. The law of karma and its inevitability may one day be a
consequence of one of the strangest results thrown up by science. That
interconnecting something may hold the key to some of the great mysteries of
life.
