Row, row, row your boat\
Gently down the stream.\
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,\
Life is but a dream.\

## From Dreams to Real Life

The nursery rhyme tells us that life is but a dream. But, imagine if someone told you that your dream could become your life. Would you be inclined to believe that statement? If you are imbued with the scientific spirit, you would at the very least subject that assertion to experimental validation or refutation. If you are of that mind, read this blog carefully, because it could be the single most important _secret of success_---academic or otherwise---that you might encounter in your entire life.

## An example from a famous life

[Dr A P J Abdul Kalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam), past-President of India, in his autobiography [_Wings of Fire_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_of_Fire_(autobiography)) recounts a deeply personal episode from his life about how his own ambition in his early years---to be an Air Force pilot---was shattered by events outside his control. Crestfallen, he wends his way to the ashram of the saintly monk, [Sri Swami Sivananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivananda_Saraswati) in [Rishikesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishikesh). Let us hear his recountal in his own words:

>It took me some time to comprehend that the opportunity to join the Air Force had just slipped through my fingers. I dragged myself out of the Selection Board and stood at the edge of a cliff. There was a lake far below. I knew that the days ahead would be difficult. There were questions to be answered and a plan of action to be prepared. I trekked down to Rishikesh.\
\
>I bathed in the Ganga and revelled in the purity of its water. Then, I walked to the [Sivananda Ashram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Life_Society) situated a little way up the hill. I could feel intense vibrations when I entered. I saw a large number of [sadhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhu) seated all around in a state of trance. I had read that sadhus were psychic people---people who know things intuitively and, in my dejected mood, I sought answers to the doubts that troubled me.\
\
>I met Swami Sivananda---a man who looked like a Buddha, wearing a snow-white dhoti and wooden slippers. He had an olive complexion and black, piercing eyes. I was struck by his irresistible, almost childlike smile and gracious manner.\
\
>I introduced myself to the Swamiji. My Muslim name aroused no reaction in him. Before I could speak any further, he inquired about the source of my sorrow. He offered no explanation of how he knew that I was sad and I did not ask.\
\
>I told him about my unsuccessful attempt to join the Indian Air Force and my long-cherished desire to fly.\
\
>He smiled, washing away all my anxiety almost instantly. Then he said in a feeble, but very deep voice, "Desire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when it is pure and intense, possesses awesome electromagnetic energy. This energy is released into the ether each night, as the mind falls into the sleep state. Each morning it returns to the conscious state reinforced with the cosmic currents. That which has been imaged will surely and certainly be manifested. You can rely, young man, upon this ageless promise as surely as you can rely upon the eternally unbroken promise of sunrise... and of Spring."\
\
>When the student is ready, the teacher will appear---How true! Here was the teacher to show the way to a student who had nearly gone astray!\
\
>“Accept your destiny and go ahead with your life. You are not destined to become an Air Force pilot. What you are destined to become is not revealed now but it is predetermined. Forget this failure, as it was essential to lead you to your destined path. Search, instead, for the true purpose of your existence. Become one with yourself, my son! Surrender yourself to the wish of God,” Swamiji said.



## Books on "manifesting"

There has been a steady procession of books on "manifesting" desires. "Manifesting" means exerting by doing  something to make your desires come true in the physical reality we inhabit.

\synopsisbox{As a student, you want to excel in your studies by putting in the effort, and reaping success at the examinations. It is the mismatch between expectations and results that leads to the slippery slope of academic failure, which robs you of the exhilaration of success, and sometimes even of the desire to achieve.

Suppose someone told you that the world that you encounter externally is really a reflection of the world you harbour within yourself in your mind. And, moreover that frustration with failure, and the futility of all effort, may be flipped completely, simply by changing the internal worldview in your mind.

Sounds too good to be true? What have you to lose? Try the method outlined in this chapter and see for yourself. I have tried it and it has worked for me as long as I played by the rules of the game.

I am deliberately not disclosing any more, to whet your appetite all the more. There is a video presentation that delivers the theory and practice behind this almost magical method. Try it and enjoy a smoother ride to academic success.}
