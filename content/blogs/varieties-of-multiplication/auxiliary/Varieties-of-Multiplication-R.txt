# To Look up

@. Many general purpose online dictionaries will give you good definitions of mathematical terms. Use them to find out the meanings of words in this blog that you do not understand or which are unfamiliar to you. The [Free Dictionary][free] is particularly good for complete and concise mathematical definitions. [Your Dictionary][yd] gives clear and simple explanations with links to more involved or specialist definitions.

@. Among the better mathematical reference sites are the following:

    -   [Wikipedia][wiki]
    -   [Wolfram MathWorld][mathworld]
    -   [PlanetMath.Org][planetmath]

    The first and last of these sites are community-driven and dynamic.

[mathworld]: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/
[planetmath]: http://planetmath.org/

@.  Develop your own sense of what constitutes a good reference site on the Web and start bookmarking suitable sites for future use.

@.  A good [glossary of mathematical terms][glossary] is available at [The Math Forum \@ Drexel.][glossary] Run through it to get a better grasp of the origins and meanings of some of the terms used in this blog.

@.  When we add a number repeatedly, we get *arithmetic growth* of which simple interest is an everyday example. When we multiply by a number repeatedly, we get *exponential growth* of which compound interest is an everyday example. Look up the mathematical formulae for these processes in a reference and compare them.

@.  Surf the web for images of a *linear spiral* and of an *exponential spiral.* Try to figure out for yourself why they are so called. If you draw a line from the origin to an arbitrary point on each spiral, what can you say about the points at which each spiral intersects the line? Can you relate these intersections to the ideas of an *arithmetic progression* and a *geometric progression* that you might have learned at school?

@.  Take the two numbers $5$ and $9$. Their *arithmetic mean* is half their sum and equals $7$. Their *geometric mean* is the square root of their product and is given by $\sqrt{45} \approx 6.7082$. Are there any numbers whose geometric and arithmetic means are the same? Is one type of mean always less than or equal to the other? How and why?

@.  Taking the square root is a form of exponentiation. If I write $\sqrt{a} = a^{p}$ can you find the value of $p$? Try extending this notation to the cube root and higher roots. [Hint: What does $(a^{p})(a^{p})$ equal?]

@.  The [real numbers][real] were introduced in this blog without fanfare because of their familiarity. But putting their meaning on mathematically rigorous foundations has demanded much effort from the best of mathematicians. The collection or [set][set] of real numbers is denoted by the symbol $\mathbb{R}.$

[set]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28mathematics%29

    The whole numbers are included in the real numbers. Find out what other types of numbers are also included in the real numbers.

@.  I glibly used the term *field of real numbers* in this blog without explaining it. The word [field][field] has a special meaning in mathematics. Fields are algebraic structures. The real and complex numbers are fields. To the extent that you are able to understand, find out what a field is.

@.  Multiplication and division are both defined for complex numbers, but only several varieties of "multiplication" are defined for vectors. Search the Web to find out why division has not been defined for vectors.

@.  The letters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\theta$ belong to the [Greek alphabet.][greek] Look them up to find out how they are written and pronounced when you have the time. Mathematicians traditionally use Greek letters when denoting angles, as we have done here.

@.  In the equation for the dot product, the expression used was $\cos(\alpha - \beta)$. Are you comfortable with this expression? Could it not equally well be $\cos(\beta - \alpha)$? Why? Does it affect the result in any way? [Hint: see the graph of $\cos x$ in this blog.]

@.  Without knowing explicitly what $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are, what can you say about:

    @. $\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u}$?
    @. $\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{u}$?
    @. $\mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v})$?
    @. $\mathbf{u}\times(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v})$?

    What do these results signify for you in plain words?

@.  The dot and cross products are both distributive over addition. This means that

    $$
    \mathbf{a}\cdot(\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{c}
    $$

    and that

    $$
    \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{c}
    $$

    Have a go at proving these assertions.

@.  In the interests of brevity, I did not touch upon two [triple products:][triple] the *scalar triple product* and the *vector triple product.* Look them up if you have the time and interest.

[triple]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_triple_product#Vector_triple_product

@.  You have been introduced to scalars, vectors, and matrices in this blog. Find out what [tensors][tensor] are and where they sit amongst these other mathematical objects. How important are varieties of multiplications in the tensor context?

[tensor]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor

@. Look up *determinants* on the Web. The way a determinant is written resembles a square matrix. Yet there is one important difference. _A determinant evaluates to a single number._ See if you can discover how a $2 \times 2$ and a $3 \times 3$ determinant are evaluated.
