Rust is _the_ emerging programming language. To learn Rust, I decided to start by solving  Euler Project One using Rust. This is a chronicle of my first efforts.

As a programmer, I am long in the tooth. I started out with FORTRAN, went on to Forth, and settled with C through three decades or more. For scripting, I used Perl or bash. Python, the current darling of programmers is an unknown bourne to me.
