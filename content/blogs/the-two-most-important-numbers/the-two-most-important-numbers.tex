The unique properties of the numbers zero and one make them
mathematically indispensable. In this slow-paced stroll though the ideas
streaming out of these two numbers. we uncover well-known as well as
relatively obscure facts about them. It is hoped that in the process we
may discover how they cement disparate areas of Mathematics.

\hypertarget{the-shy-one}{%
\subsection{The shy one}\label{the-shy-one}}

The number one is often
\href{https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/implicit}{implicit} in
mathematical notation. While we may write \(2x\) to denote
\(2\times x\), or two multiplied by \(x\), we \emph{do not} write
\(1x\), even if it is literally correct, because of convention. In
instances like this, the number one is implicit, and assumed to be
understood by those who know. If you happen to be one of those
\emph{not} in the know, here's your chance to join the other side.

When we write a fraction as \(\frac{3}{4}\) we mean the decimal \(0.75\)
and matters are clear. But all whole numbers are also fractions with the
denominator being \(1\). So, the fraction \(\frac{3}{1}\) is rarely
written in that form, even if syntactically correct, because usage
dictates that whole numbers are written to stand on their own, as \(3\),
in this case. Again, the \(1\) in the denominator is assumed to be
unobtrusively present:
\href{https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/out-of-sight-out-of-mind}{out
of sight but \emph{not} out of mind}.

When we write \(4^2\), spoken out as ``four squared'' we mean the number
obtained by multiplying \(4\) by itself. This nomenclature arose
because, if 4 was associated with the \emph{length} of, say, a piece of
string, the number ``four squared'' was used to denote the \emph{area}
of a square that had a side of length \(4\). So,
\(4^2 = 4\times4 = 16\).

Likewise, the expression \(7^3\) or ``seven cubed'' denoted the volume
of a cube of side \(7\). Beyond the third dimension, this naming scheme
faded out, because we cannot percieve dimensions higher than three.

Therefore, \(6^4\) is spoken as ``six raised to the fourth (power)'' or
``six to the four''. In such statements, the number \(6\) is called the
\emph{base} and the number \(4\) is called the \emph{exponent}.

Following this logic, we might assert that \(5^1 = 5\) and that is
perfectly correct. But again, convention intrudes to say that we write
it simply as \(5\). \emph{Any number raised to the power of \(1\) equals
itself}.

The notation making \(1\) implicit in these scenarios reduces clutter
and simplifies notation. The absence of the implicit \(1\) might trouble
the heart of the sincere young mathematician, but familiarity with these
conventions will make for comfort in using them.

\hypertarget{the-additive-and-multiplicative-identities}{%
\subsection{The additive and multiplicative
identities}\label{the-additive-and-multiplicative-identities}}

When mathematicians in the nineteenth century contemplated the then
extant mathematical systems, they recognized certain commonalities.
Whether it was arithmetic or geometry, or some other branch of
mathematics, they were able to distil certain underlying principles
behind the common practices of mathematics. By systematizing and
classifying what they observed, they were able to \emph{invent} names
for the \emph{classes of objects} they discerned, along with their
properties. Thus was born
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra}{abstract algebra}.
The ideas of the additive and multiplicative identity were born from
this exercise in classification.

The numbers we use for counting, starting from \(1\), and never ending,
are called the \emph{natural numbers}. The collection or \emph{set} of
these numbers is denoted \(\mathbb{N}\). We can add and multiply these
numbers.

For example, we have seen that multiplying \(5\) by \(1\) gives the
original number \(5\). The number \(1\) is called the
\emph{multiplicative identity} because multiplying any natural number by
\(1\) preserves the original number.

What do you think is the additive equivalent, the \emph{additive
identity}? We know that if we add \(0\) to any number, we get the
original number again. So, \(0\) \emph{preserves} the original number
intact after addition. But is \(0\) in the set \(\mathbb{N}\)? Not as we
have defined it here.\footnote{Some folks do include \(0\) in the set
  \(\mathbb{N}\).} Nevertheless, we may posit that under appropriate
conditions, the additive identity is \(0\).

Zero and one enjoy their
\href{https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/coign-of-vantage}{coign
of vantage} because they are the additive and multiplicative identities
respectively: \[
\begin{aligned}
a + 0 = a\\
a \times 1 = a
\end{aligned}
\] where \(a\) is an arbitrary number, of the sort we are familiar
with\footnote{This is an easy-to-read blog; so I will not belabour the
  reader with the finer points of different types of number, but will
  reserve them for a later blog.}.

Mathematics as a discipline tends to generalize and extend simple ideas
to increasing levels of complexity, while at the same time maintaining
consistency in definition and behaviour across these disparate domains.

It should come as no surprise that some objects called
matrices\footnote{I facetiously call them numbers in teabags} (singular
matrix) also have their additive and multiplicative identities,
\emph{where applicable}. We will consider an arbitrary \emph{square
matrix} \(\begin{bmatrix} a & b\\c & d \end{bmatrix}\) having four
elements, and called a \(2 \times 2\) matrix. Then,
\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:multidmatrix}{}{
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
= %
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
}\label{eq:multidmatrix}\end{equation} and
\(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\) is the multiplicative
identity for matrix multiplication.\footnote{The rules of matrix
  multiplication are a little involved and will not detain us here. The
  interested reader is referred to another blog of mine for details.}

Likewise, \begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:addidmatrix}{}{
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
+ %
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0\\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
= %
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
}\label{eq:addidmatrix}\end{equation} and
\(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0\\0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\) is the additive identity
for matrix addition.

Do you see how the seed ideas of the additive and multiplicative
identities, sown far and wide, germinate into shoots that are
surprisingly similar to the original ones. The numbers \(0\) and \(1\)
do indeed rule the roost. Obviously, the identity matrices will change
with the matrix sizes, but the principles remain the same.

\hypertarget{exponentiation}{%
\subsection{Exponentiation}\label{exponentiation}}

Exponentiation may also be called \emph{raising (something) to a power}.
It is a short form for repeated multiplication by the \emph{same}
number. For example, if we multiply \(5\) by itself three times, we
write it so: \begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:exp}{}{
5\times5\times5 = 5^1\times5^1\times5^1 = 5^{(1+1+1)} = 5^{3} = 125
}\label{eq:exp}\end{equation} The number \(5\) is called the \emph{base}
and the power \(3\) is called the \emph{exponent}. As noted before,
\(5^1 = 5\) and the exponent \(1\) is omitted.
