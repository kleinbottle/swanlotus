<h1 class="title">The Two Most Important Numbers: Zero and One</h1>
<p class="author">R (Chandra) Chandrasekhar</p>
<p class="date">2023-10-31</p>
</header>
<p>The unique properties of the numbers zero and one make them
mathematically interesting and indispensable. In this slow-paced stroll
though the ideas streaming out of these two numbers, we uncover
well-known as well as relatively obscure facts about them. It is hoped
that in the process we may discover how they cement together disparate
areas of Mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="starting-at-the-beginning">Starting at the beginning</h2>
<p>At first, I thought I would skirt around the formal sets of numbers,
and concepts like commutativity and associativity, and keep this blog
very informal. But I found that each time I tried that approach, I would
have to furtively sneak in a paragraph here, or a footnote there, to
explain these ideas. In the end, I decided to start at the beginning,
and work my way through the natural numbers, the integers, the
rationals, etc., and <a
href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/broach">broach</a> ideas like
commutativity and associativity.</p>
<h2 id="counting">Counting</h2>
<p>Aeons ago, a shepherd with five sheep might have counted, “one sheep,
two sheep, three sheep, four sheep, and five sheep.” But wait! Since he
did not have the names for numbers—nor indeed the abstract concept of a
number—he could not have done that. So, what did he do? Let us
speculate.</p>
<h3 id="naming-sheep">Naming sheep</h3>
<p>He could have given <em>unique</em> names to each of his five sheep
and developed enough familiarity with them to identify them by name.
Then all he needed to do was to check that his entire flock was home by
sundown. But such a method would have become cumbersome and error-prone
as his sheep multiplied.</p>
<h3 id="one-to-one-correspondence">One-to-one correspondence</h3>
<p>The later, and more likely, alternative was to use stones to
correspond to sheep. He could have taken a leather bag and dropped a
stone in it—one for each sheep that he owned. He did not need to learn
counting. All he needed to do was to establish a <a
href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/one-one-correspondence">one-to-one
correspondence</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> between sheep and stone. As long as
he had the right number of stones in his bag, he could account for each
one of his sheep.</p>
<p>The Latin word for <em>stone</em> is <a
href="https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=calculus">calculus</a>, and
from the stone has come the whole science of <em>calculation</em>.</p>
<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>
<p>When we <em>count</em>, as with sheep, where do we start? We start
with one. We do not start with zero, because we cannot point to any
sheep or other object and say “zero”.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, zero has fundamental importance when we start
<em>measuring</em>. When the petrol tank in a car is empty, we can fill
it up and measure the volume of petrol for which we have to pay.</p>
<p>When we count, we start with <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>When we measure, we start with <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="sets-of-numbers">Sets of numbers</h2>
<p>Although Mathematics has rigorous foundations, at the very bottom,
its notions are not defined <a
href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/explicitly">explicitly</a>.
One such notion is that of a <em>set</em>, which is loosely defined as a
collection of objects that can either be enumerated or described
clearly. The <em>sets of numbers</em> we will deal with have names,
symbols, and definitions as shown below.</p>

While it is premature to talk about these sets and their peculiarities
in this blog, it is worth making some points about them.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The symbols in the second column are called <a
href="https://oeis.org/wiki/Blackboard_bold">blackboard bold</a>
letters.</p></li>
<li><p>A set is traditionally enclosed in a pair of <em>braces</em>:
<span class="math inline">\(\{\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Zero is neither positive nor negative. It is itself. As a set on
its own, zero is often denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The numbers we use for counting, starting from <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and never ending, are—naurally
enough—called the <a
href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NaturalNumber.html"><em>natural
numbers</em></a>, denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. There is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">no agreement on
whether or not to include zero</a> as a member of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. I have chosen not to, because
we start counting with one.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer"><em>integers</em></a> are
named <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> after the German
word <em>Zahlen</em> which stands for “numbers” (singular
<em>Zahl</em>). The integers include positive and negative whole numbers
as well as zero.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a
href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RationalNumber.html"><em>rational
numbers</em></a> are so named because they are really <em>ratios</em> of
whole numbers with the proviso that the denominator cannot be zero. The
symbol <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> is used because
it denotes <em>quotient</em> the result of <em>division</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no symbol for the <a
href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IrrationalNumber.html"><em>irrationals</em></a>,
which are simply defined as numbers which are <em>not rational</em>. In
fact, the set of irrationals may shown, using set notation only
indirectly as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, which
means the set of real numbers, excluding the rational numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"><em>real
numbers</em></a>, with symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> for real, are glibly described
as the union of the rational numbers and the irrational numbers.<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"><em>complex</em>
numbers</a> incorporate a non-real entity, called <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> the <em>imaginary unit</em>, which is
defined as <span class="math inline">\(i^2 = -1\)</span>. Since every
real number when squared is greater than or equal to zero, this <span

demands its own symbol, arithmetic, and set, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>.</p></li>

<h2 id="abstract-algebra">Abstract Algebra</h2>
<p>In the nineteenth century, mathematicians contemplated the then
extant mathematical systems and recognized certain commonalities.
Whether it was arithmetic or geometry, or some other branch of
mathematics, they were able to distil certain underlying principles
behind the common practices of mathematics. By systematizing and
classifying what they observed, they were able to <em>invent</em> names
for the <em>classes of objects</em> they discerned, along with their
properties. Thus was born <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra">abstract
algebra</a>. The ideas of commutativity, associativity, the additive and
multiplicative identities, and the additive and multiplicative inverses
were born from this exercise in classification.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-arithmetic-operations">The Four Arithmetic
Operations</h2>
<p>Each of the four basic arithmetic operations–addition,
multiplication, subtraction, division—are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Binary_operation&amp;oldid=1182322931">binary</a>
operations and may <em>only</em> be performed between <em>two</em>
numbers. The ability to <em>add</em> multiple numbers—as in determining
the total sum to be paid at the checkout counter while shopping—is made
possible by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property">commutativity</a>
and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property">associativity</a>
of addition, which also applies to multiplication. Subtraction and
division are neither commutative nor associative.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="commutativity-and-associativity">Commutativity and
Associativity</h3>
<p>Let us add three numbers, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. It is common to write this as <span
class="math inline">\(2 + 3 + 5 = 10\)</span>. The sum <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> is correct, but its correctness is
derived from the commutativity and associativity of addition.</p>
<p>In commutativity, we have <span class="math display">\[
2 + 3 = 3 + 2.
\]</span> <em>The order of the two operands may be
interchanged</em>.</p>
<p>In associativity, we have <em>three operands</em>. We use parentheses
to denote the operation we perform first. It does not matter which pair
we add first. <span class="math display">\[
(2 + 3) + 5 = 2 + (3 + 5).
\]</span> Together, commutativity and associativity allow us to be
casual about the order in which we add several numbers.</p>
<p>Multiplication is repeated addition. It is thus both commutative and
associative. Figure <a href="#fig:mult">1</a> gives a geometric
perspective of multiplication.</p>
<figure id="fig:mult">
<img src="%7Battach%7Dimages/four-by-three.png" class="modal-target"

<figcaption>Figure 1: The products <span
class="math inline">\(4\times3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(3\times4\)</span> amount to repeated additions and
yield the same result of 12.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Talking about commutativity and associativity might seem like
overkill for the addition and multiplication of real numbers. But,
identifying these properties is a useful insight, as the more
sophisticated mathematical objects we will encounter later may not obey
either or both properties.</p>
<h2 id="the-additive-and-multiplicative-identities-in-mathbbr">The
additive and multiplicative identities in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span></h2>
<p>When zero is added to any real number, <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, we get the original number <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> back as the sum: <span
id="eq:addident"><span class="math display">\[
a + 0 = 0 + a = a.
\qquad{(1)}\]</span></span> We call <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> the <em>additive identity</em> for
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Likewise, when we multiply <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> by
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, the original number is returned
as the product: <span id="eq:multident"><span class="math display">\[
a \times 1 = 1 \times a = a
\qquad{(2)}\]</span></span> The number <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is called the <em>multiplicative
identity</em>.</p>
<p>Zero and one enjoy their <a
href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/coign-of-vantage">coign
of vantage</a> as the additive and multiplicative identities
respectively for the real numbers in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. But are their roles
generalizable to cover a larger variety of mathematical objects?</p>
<p>Mathematics as a discipline tends to generalize and extend simple
ideas to increasing levels of complexity, while at the same time
maintaining consistency in definition and behaviour across these
disparate domains. The additive and multiplicative identities may be so
generalized, where applicable.</p>
<h2 id="varieties-of-additive-and-multiplicative-identities">Varieties
of additive and multiplicative identities</h2>
<p>The zero of the complex numbers is <span class="math inline">\(0 +
i(0) = 0\)</span> as well. And adding it to any complex number returns
the original complex number.</p>
<p><a
href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polynomial.html">Polynomials</a> are
expressions like <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + 3x + 1\)</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is some real or complex variable.
The zero polynomial is simply the constant polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(P(x) = 0\)</span>, and adding it to any polynomial
again gives us back the original polynomial.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Matrix.html">matrix</a> is a
rectangular array of numbers, treated as a single unit mathematically. I
facetiously call matrices <em>numbers in teabags</em>. Operations on
matrices follow their own definitions.</p>
<p>The matrix <span class="math inline">\(\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0\\0
&amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\)</span> is the additive identity for matrix
addition for <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span>
matrices.</p>
<p>Let us consider an arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(2 \times
2\)</span> <em>square matrix</em> like <span
class="math inline">\(\begin{bmatrix}a &amp; b\\c &amp;
d\end{bmatrix}\)</span>. It has two horizontal rows and two vertical
columns, and therefore 4 elements. The additive identity for this matrix
is a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> square matrix, all
of whose entries are zero: <span id="eq:addidmatrix"><span
class="math display">\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; b\\
c &amp; d
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; b\\
c &amp; d
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; b\\
c &amp; d
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad{(3)}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The matrix <span class="math inline">\(\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\0
&amp; 1\end{bmatrix}\)</span> is the multiplicative identity for matrix
multiplication for <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span>
matrices.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Note that its elements are solely
ones and zeroes, with ones on the -principal diagonal from top left to
bottom right. <span id="eq:multidmatrix"><span class="math display">\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; b\\
c &amp; d
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0\\

\end{bmatrix}
= %
\begin{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}

\end{bmatrix}
\qquad{(4)}\]</span></span></p>
<p>This is a simple example of how the seed ideas of the additive and
multiplicative identities, sown far and wide, germinate into shoots that
are surprisingly similar to the original ones. The numbers <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> do indeed rule the roost. Obviously,
the identity matrices will change with the matrix sizes, but the
principles remain the same.</p>
<h2 id="the-additive-and-multiplicative-inverses-in-mathbbr">The
additive and multiplicative inverses in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span></h2>
<p>The negative integers arose from subtractions like <span
class="math inline">\((3 - 5)\)</span>, whose result was not a positive
integer, and therefore lay outside the confines of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> both contain negative numbers
and can therefore lay claim to an additive inverse. Simply put, the
additive inverse of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the same
number prefixed with a minus sign, having a value such that: <span
id="eq:addinv"><span class="math display">\[
a + (-a) = 0 = (-a) + a
\qquad{(5)}\]</span></span> If you have heard of <a
href="https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/september-2008/antimatters-science-fiction-debut?language_content_entity=und">particle
and anti-particles annihilating each other in Science Fiction</a>, you
can metaphorically think of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(-a\)</span> as one such pair.</p>
<h2 id="the-arithmetic-four-revisited">The Arithmetic Four
Revisited</h2>
<h2 id="addition">Addition</h2>
<p>If we start with zero and add one to it, we get one. If we add one to
that we get two. In this fashion, all the natural numbers may be
generated successively by adding one. The <em>next number</em> is called
the <em>successor</em>. Even if we did not start with zero, but started
with one, instead, we can still generate the entire set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> by adding one successively.
This method shows that there is no largest natural number. If there were
such a number, say <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, we could
always add one to it and show the assumption to be false. In this sense,
one helps us to understand infinity (of the countable variety).</p>
<h2 id="subtraction">Subtraction</h2>
<p>Subtracting zero from a number leaves it unchanged. Subtracting a
larger natural number from a smaller one gives a negative number and
this is the main reason for expanding the set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> into the set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>
<p>By convention, when a sign is not prefixed to a number, we assume it
to be positive. If a negative sign is prefixed to a number, it is a
negative number. This is indicated by a pair of parentheses—surrounding
the number and its sign—in expressions. When the number is featured
alone, these parentheses are dropped.</p>
<p>With signed numbers, we may convert any subtraction into an addition
like this: <span id="eq:negnum"><span class="math display">\[
3 - 5 = -2 = 3 + (-5) = (-5) + 3.
\qquad{(6)}\]</span></span> In this way, we could convert subtractions
into additions, and those additions would still be commutative. This
does not mean that subtraction has suddenly become commutative; it has
not. It simply means that subtraction can be morphed into the addition
of signed numbers.</p>
<p>Every real number <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has an
<em>additive inverse</em>, <span class="math inline">\(a&#39;\)</span>
such that: <span class="math display">\[
a + a&#39; = a&#39; + a = 0.
\]</span> Any guesses as to what <span
class="math inline">\(a&#39;\)</span> is? It is the signed number <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> prefixed with a negative sign and
written as <span class="math inline">\(-a\)</span>, i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(a&#39; = -a\)</span>. It is noteworthy, that when
we subtract any real number from itself, we get zero, by the property of
the additive inverse: <span class="math display">\[
a - a = a + (-a) = 0.
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="multiplication">Multiplication</h2>
<p>Multiplying any number by zero yields zero: <span
class="math inline">\(a \times 0 = 0 \times a = 0\)</span>. This might
be a little difficult to grasp. To justify this assertion, let us try to
multiply <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
5 \times 0 = 5 \times (2 - 2) = 5 \times (2 + (-2)) = 10 - 10 = 0.
\]</span> We could replace the number <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> by the arbitrary <span
class="math inline">\(a \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> and the statement would
still be valid.</p>
<p>Zero was already a problematic number that had been introduced into
Europe from India. Can imagine the effort that must have gone into
understanding and justifying that multiplication of any number by zero
yielded zero? Zero, one, and infinity are a daunting triad. Mastering
them takes time, practice, and familiarity.</p>
<p>Multiplying a number by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> leaves
it unchanged. The number <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is the
<em>multiplicative identity</em> element for the real numbers. So, <span
class="math inline">\(5 \times 1 = 1 \times 5 = 5\)</span>.</p>
<p>Multiplying <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> yields the additive inverse of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, namely <span
class="math inline">\(-a\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the context of <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span>
matrices, there is a matrix that functions as the multiplicative
identity as shown in Equation <a href="#eq:matmultident">7</a>. <span
id="eq:matmultident"><span class="math display">\[

<h2 id="the-shy-one">The shy one</h2>
<p>The number one is often <a
href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/implicit">implicit</a> in
mathematical notation. While we may write <span
class="math inline">\(2x\)</span> to denote <span
class="math inline">\(2\times x\)</span>, or two multiplied by <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we <em>do not</em> write <span
class="math inline">\(1x\)</span>, even if it is literally correct,
because of convention. In instances like this, the number one is
implicit, and assumed to be understood by those who know. If you happen
to be one of those <em>not</em> in the know, here’s your chance to join
the other side.</p>
<p>When we write a fraction as <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{4}\)</span> we mean the decimal <span
class="math inline">\(0.75\)</span> and matters are clear. But all whole
numbers are also fractions with the denominator being <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. So, the fraction <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{1}\)</span> is rarely written in that
form, even if syntactically correct, because usage dictates that whole
numbers are written to stand on their own, as <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, in this case. Again, the <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in the denominator is assumed to be
unobtrusively present: <a
href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/out-of-sight-out-of-mind">out
of sight but <em>not</em> out of mind</a>.</p>
<p>When we write <span class="math inline">\(4^2\)</span>, spoken out as
“four squared” we mean the number obtained by multiplying <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> by itself. This nomenclature arose
because, if 4 was associated with the <em>length</em> of, say, a piece
of string, the number “four squared” was used to denote the
<em>area</em> of a square that had a side of length <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. So, <span class="math inline">\(4^2 =
4\times4 = 16\)</span>.</p>
<p>Likewise, the expression <span class="math inline">\(7^3\)</span> or
“seven cubed” denoted the volume of a cube of side <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. Beyond the third dimension, this
naming scheme faded out, because we cannot percieve dimensions higher
than three.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(6^4\)</span> is spoken as “six
raised to the fourth (power)” or “six to the four”. In such statements,
the number <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is called the
<em>base</em> and the number <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is
called the <em>exponent</em>.</p>
<p>Following this logic, we might assert that <span
class="math inline">\(5^1 = 5\)</span> and that is perfectly correct.
But again, convention intrudes to say that we write it simply as <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. <em>Any number raised to the power of
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> equals itself</em>.</p>
<p>The notation making <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> implicit
in these scenarios reduces clutter and simplifies notation. The absence
of the implicit <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> might trouble the
heart of the sincere young mathematician, but familiarity with these
conventions will make for comfort in using them.</p>
<h2 id="zero-one-and-repeated-addition">Zero, one, and repeated
addition</h2>
<p>All natural numbers may be generated by zero, one, and repeated
addition: <span id="eq:success1"><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
0 + 1 = 1
\end{aligned}
\qquad{(8)}\]</span></span> <span id="eq:success2"><span
class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
1 + 1 = 2
\end{aligned}
\qquad{(9)}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The <em>next natural number</em> is obtained by adding in the
sequence is generated by adding <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>
to the current number._ By repeating this process, we can generate any
desired natural number.</p>

<h3 id="why-we-cannot-divide-by-zero">Why we cannot divide by zero</h3>
<h2 id="exponentiation">Exponentiation</h2>
<p>Exponentiation may also be called <em>raising (something) to a
power</em>. It is a short form for repeated multiplication by the
<em>same</em> number. For example, if we multiply <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> by itself three times, we write it so:
<span id="eq:exp"><span class="math display">\[
5\times5\times5 = 5^1\times5^1\times5^1 = 5^{(1+1+1)} = 5^{3} = 125
\qquad{(10)}\]</span></span> The number <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> is called the <em>base</em> and the
power <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> is called the
<em>exponent</em>. As noted before, <span class="math inline">\(5^1 =
5\)</span> and the exponent <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is
omitted.</p>
<p>The reciprocal of an arbitrary non-zero real number <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{a}\)</span>. The product of the two is
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Written with an exponent, <span
class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{a} = a^{-1}.
\]</span> Continuing with the number <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> in our example, its reciprocal is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{5} = 5^{-1}\)</span>. What do we get if
we multiply <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> by its reciprocal? We
areready know the answer to be <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.
Let us do the multiplication using exponents: <span
id="eq:reciprocal"><span class="math display">\[
5 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1 = 5^{1} \times 5^{-1} = 5^{1+(-1)} = 5^{0}.
\qquad{(11)}\]</span></span> The astounding conclusion from Equation <a
href="#eq:reciprocal">11</a> is that a base raised to the exponent zero
is <span class="math inline">\({1}\)</span>. <em>By extension, any
integer raised to the to the zeroth power equals <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span></em>. This remarkable conclusion
applies to <em>any real number</em> as well: something that will be
understood better after we encounter <a
href="https://www.britannica.com/science/logarithm">logarithms</a> in
this series of blogs or elsewhere. The consequence is that the logarithm
of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to any base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>: <span id="eq:logonezero"><span
class="math display">\[
log_{b}1 = 0.
\qquad{(12)}\]</span></span> Equation <a href="#eq:logonezero">12</a> is
yet another memorable equation linking <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. When the domain of mathematics expands
to take on new numbers, new objects, and new notations, the need for
consistency with the existing body of mathematics gives us pearls such
as equation Equation <a href="#eq:logonezero">12</a>.</p>
