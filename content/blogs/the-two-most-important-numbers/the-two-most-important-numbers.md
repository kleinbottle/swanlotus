## Multiplication

## Division

### Why we cannot divide by zero


## Exponentiation

Exponentiation may also be called _taking powers_. It is a short from for repeated multiplication by the _same_ number. For example, if we multiply $5$ by itself three times, we write it so:
$$
5\times5\times5 = 5^{3} = 125
$${#eq:exp}
The number $5$ is called the _base_ and power $3$ s called the _exponent_.
