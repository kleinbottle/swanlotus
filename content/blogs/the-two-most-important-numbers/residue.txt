## Fundamental properties of zero

Is not a factor of any number other than itself.

Cannot be the denominator of any rational number.

Is the additive identity.

Zeroes in control theory

Zeroes of polynomials

Laplace transforms from ODE to polynomials

Galois: polynomial roots

Poles and zeroes

Division by zero functions becoming unbounded at points where division by zero is attempted

Renormaliztion theory: Quantum and Relativity: problem oc functions "blowing up" that preclude a conclusive theory

Stability and the s-plane. The importance of zero. s = sigma + j omega exponential and the value

a ^0 = 1 etc.



## Fundamental properties of ones

Generates successor numbers and therefore the entire sets N and Z.

Multiplicative inverse.

Control systems and the number (-1, 0)

Radius of convergence and the change in powers of as number
GP

Curves of x^n for x < 1 and n -> infinity

## Zero, one, and repeated addition

All natural numbers may be generated by zero, one, and repeated addition:
$$
\begin{aligned}
0 + 1 = 1
\end{aligned}
$${#eq:success1}
$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + 1 = 2
\end{aligned}
$${#eq:success2}

The _next natural number_ is obtained by adding in the sequence is generated by adding $1$ to the current number._ By repeating this process, we can generate any desired natural number.

## Primes

Is one the first prime? No!



Stuff

arose out of the solutions to polynomial equations that did not have roots in the real number system. To put it in a picture, the graphs of some polynomials did not intersect the $x$-axis as many times as they should have.
