OLD STUFF

Let us suppose that you have been hired by a firm of consulting philosophers to design a logo for their establishment. They want something impressive, memorable, and easily recognized as pertaining to philosophy. They have left it to you to decide whether it would be an image of some sort, or an icon, or a shield, or plain text.

You mull over the possibilities and weigh them against your own skill-set. You decide against, for example a statue of Socrates, <!--See if a picture can be provided for this.--> because not everyone will recognize the person depicted and what he stood for.

You next consider something from mathematical logic along the lines of $p \implies q \iff \not q \implies \not p$. But you give up on that because it is too specialized and only partially representative of philosophy.

Then you remember Karl Popper and his hypothesis of falsifiability as the basis of science. Some scientists, you recall, rejected _string theory_ simply because it made no predictions that could be subject to the test of falsifiability. But how in heaven would you squeeze that into a logo? And wouldn't that narrow it to the philosophy of science rather than to all of philosophy.

Weary and teary after much squinting at screens and books, you fall into a refreshing sleep or reverie---you know not which. In your mind's eye you met a man who mouthed something that sounded foreign, but you were hard pressed to identify what pearls of wisdom he had mouthed. But his face was etched in your mind to persist long after the dream. And what a face. A head with a shock of dark hair that fell to his shoulders, a pair of piercing, knowing eyes, and a sparse moustache and goatee.

Somewhat inspired but also benumbed, you scantily searched
