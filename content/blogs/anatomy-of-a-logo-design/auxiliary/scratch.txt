OLD STUFF

Let us suppose that you have been hired by a firm of consulting philosophers to design a logo for their establishment. They want something impressive, memorable, and easily recognized as pertaining to philosophy. They have left it to you to decide whether it would be an image of some sort, or an icon, or a shield, or plain text.

You mull over the possibilities and weigh them against your own skill-set. You decide against, for example a statue of Socrates, <!--See if a picture can be provided for this.--> because not everyone will recognize the person depicted and what he stood for.

You next consider something from mathematical logic along the lines of $p \implies q \iff \not q \implies \not p$. But you give up on that because it is too specialized and only partially representative of philosophy.

Then you remember Karl Popper and his hypothesis of falsifiability as the basis of science. Some scientists, you recall, rejected _string theory_ simply because it made no predictions that could be subject to the test of falsifiability. But how in heaven would you squeeze that into a logo? And wouldn't that narrow it to the philosophy of science rather than to all of philosophy.

Weary and teary after much squinting at screens and books, you fall into a refreshing sleep or reverie---you know not which. In your mind's eye you met a man who mouthed something that sounded foreign, but you were hard pressed to identify what pearls of wisdom he had mouthed. But his face was etched in your mind to persist long after the dream. And what a face. A head with a shock of dark hair that fell to his shoulders, a pair of piercing, knowing eyes, and a sparse moustache and goatee.

Somewhat inspired but also benumbed, you scantily searched

### Typesetting text professionally

Word processors have been around since the late seventies, but professional electronic typesetting took its birth in XXXX when a professor at Stanford University named Donald E Knuth developed and released top the world free-of-charge a program called TeX (pronounced XXX) that we intended to "typeset beautiful mathematics".

That program was not an easy one to master and it has spawned augmentations called _formats_, the most well-known of which is the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) document preparation system. LaTeX has traditionally been hemmed in by the types of fonts it could use, among other limitations. Its more recent relative---another format called XeLaTeX---overcomes this limitation. One result is the possibility of typesetting languages having a non-Latin script. Another advantage is that XeLaTeX allows for typesetting RL languages. Yet another benefit of XeLaTeX is the possibility of using its output to design logos, which is what we will discuss here.

### Why not a graphics program?

Why would one take the route of professional typesetting when there are so many free and not-so-free graphical programs that may be used to typeset a logo in a matter of minutes/ Why bother taking a tortuous route that involves writing in a markup language and debugging it until the desired result is achieved?

I will list my reasons for taking this route. Working with a graphics program usually involves placing and editing graphical objects interactively using a mouse. The final desired result may be frozen, but it cannot be changed easily. Depending on how significant the change is, considerable effort might be demanded. This is something I look upon askance because 

Change of colour, moving one object a smidgen, improving the kerning or any number of other changes---major or minor---may be programmatically made and repeatably too because what is involved is change of the "markup source code".

When edits are made by hand and the result tweaked by eye,what is obtained is optimal but not repeatable. If one were to change somet
