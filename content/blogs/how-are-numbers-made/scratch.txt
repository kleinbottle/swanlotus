## "I made a wager"

"I made a wager", my friend Solus "Sol" Simkin opened up the other day. We were enjoying the warmth of a spring afternoon, with just the right balance of light and shade, just the right balance of heat and cold, and a humidity that could have descended from Heaven. I might have slipped into the delicious oblivion of sleep, were it not for the fact that I cherished hearing Sol, even more than I desired sleep. So, I was all agog to hear him regale yet another tale from his intellectual adventures.

"Tell me about your wager," I responded.

"I think you know of my paternal cousin, once removed, Hieronymus Septimus Simkin, whom I affectionately call Seven. Well, he is an expert in matters Microsoft, and is no mean programmer himself. Seven and I were holidaying once at [Loch Lomond](https://www.nationalparks.uk/park/loch-lomond-the-trossachs/) in Scotland.

"We were drinking in the beauty of scenic Nature when a thought struck me like a thunderbolt.  That instant, I was convinced that Kronecker was as wrong as wrong could be.

"I mentioned this to Seven, but he laughed it off. A little miffed, I told Seven that I would convince him that Kronecker was wrong, and was prepared to bet on it. There are many open secrets of mathematics all around us. All of them cry out that he was wrong."

Seven---never one to withdraw from an engagement with probability---said, "You are on. I _know_ that [encryption of secrets](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-encryption) is grounded in the integers. Integers guard our very secrets. So, you are bound to lose."

"And so began a discussion on the open secrets of mathematics that took us into the realms of the integers, the rationals, the irrationals, $\pi$, $e$, $\phi$, etc.," continued Sol.
