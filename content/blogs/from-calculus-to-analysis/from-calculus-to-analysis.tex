Portions of this blog have been taken from the chapter entitled
``Mathematics at University'' from my book,
\href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/sas}{\emph{Secrets of Academic
Success}}, which is
\href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/sas-manuscript/SAS-partial.pdf}{available
as a free PDF download}. Since that chapter was written, I have gained
greater understanding on why calculus at high school needed to morph
into analysis at university. Accordingly, the material has been
augmented, but kept simple enough to be accessible to a high school
student just entering university.

I am not a professional mathematician, and make no claim to rigour in
this blog. Rather, I hope to demystify analysis from the grip of symbols
by explaining its
\href{https://www.thefreedictionary.com/raison+d+etre}{\emph{raison
d'être}} in plain English. In the process, I hope analysis appears less
forbidding and more friendly.

\subsection{The transition from high school to
university}\label{the-transition-from-high-school-to-university}

At high school you were taught how to integrate and differentiate. You
were exposed to all sorts of tricks and special techniques to compute
specific integrals, especially those involving inverse trigonometric
functions, and so on. If you revelled in mastering and applying such
techniques, you might find that what succeeds high school
\emph{calculus}, is a horse of an entirely different colour, called
\emph{analysis}, at university.

You might even be alarmed that rather than have to solve routine
problems for the value of some quantity, or simply to work through and
demonstrate a fact in a straightforward fashion, you are now required to
prove theorems: something that requires a different mindset and skill
set.

\subsection{Why the change?}\label{why-the-change}

High school calculus appeals to intuition and the visual sense, through
\emph{geometric} ideas like slopes and areas. Words like ``approaches'',
``tends to'', etc., signify motion and resonate with our sense of space
and time.

Analysis, on the other hand, is logically precise and uses
\emph{arithmetic} as the basis for deriving results. Intuition has given
way to logical precision, and pictures have yielded to symbols. The
implicit scaffolding of familiar ideas like space and time---borrowed
from our everyday experience---has been replaced with the clinical
precision of inequalities and universal and existential quantifiers.

The logically indefensible infinitesimals of calculus have given way to
the rigorously justifiable limits and infinite sums of analysis. Numbers
alone provide the foundation, and this required the idea of a number
itself to be strengthened as an abstraction beyond question or doubt.

All this takes some getting used to. We have moved from an innocent
nature-hewn cave to a fabricated apartment block that reaches for the
sky. Questions such as, ``Is this change really necessary?'' and ``If it
ain't broke, why fix it?'' arise in consequence.

But the sober truth is that high school calculus \emph{is} ``broke''. It
is fun-filled, but nevertheless, a convenient fiction by mathematical
standards. Two centuries passed between the discovery of the calculus as
a magical computing machine and the recognition of the need to fix it so
that it would work robustly in all circumstances.

In this sense, the progression from calculus to analysis is similar to
the accretion of zero and the negative numbers to the natural numbers,
or the introduction of imaginary numbers to account for roots of certain
polynomials. All such changes were resisted at first, just like a new
pair of shoes that initially pinch, but time and usage have borne
testament to the wisdom behind the change. The somewhat painful
transition from calculus to analysis will prove to be the same.

\subsection{Geometry's fall from
favour}\label{geometrys-fall-from-favour}

Mathematics texts at high school level are generously and often
colorfully illustrated, especially when dealing with geometry. But, if
you look at any university-level analysis textbook, colour would have
taken heel, and pictures will be the exception rather than the norm. For
those who think in pictures, this will come as a letdown, accompanied by
the puzzling question, ``Why?''

Geometric intuition, upon which Greek mathematics rested securely for
well nigh two centuries, was not infallible. The development of new
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry}{non-Euclidean
geometries} in the nineteenth century robbed mathematics of its innocent
certitude in geometric foundations. And the resulting revolution, called
the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program}{Erlangen
program}, made algebra the basis of classifying geometry itself.

Our everyday experience is rooted in our sense of space and time. So, I
will attempt to illustrate the ideas of analysis using pictures wherever
I can, so that the alien syntax and symbology of analysis is buttressed
by the reassuring presence of equivalent pictures. Unfortunately, many
introductory analysis books are illustrated scantily if at all.

\subsection{Holes in the real number line: irrational
numbers}\label{holes-in-the-real-number-line-irrational-numbers}

What do irrational numbers have to do with analysis? Quite a lot,
really.

Real analysis lives on the real number line. From the time of the
Pythagoreans, the irrational numbers have caused mathematicians' hearts
to skip a beat. ``Are irrational numbers really numbers? If so, where do
they live?''

The Greeks circumvented this by limiting the irrational numbers to
geometric contexts. The ratio of the circumference of a unit circle to
its diameter is \(\pi\). The diagonal of a unit square is \(\sqrt{2}\).
``Let them live geometrically as \emph{lengths}, but let us remain
silent about their existence elsewhere.'' It was a dichotomy between
\emph{counting} and \emph{measurement} or between the \emph{discrete}
and the \emph{continuous}.

Even today, the sets for the \emph{natural numbers}, the
\emph{integers}, the \emph{rational numbers} all have their own symbols,
\(\mathbb{N}\), \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(\mathbb{Q}\), respectively, but not
the irrational numbers. That should be clue enough to indicate that the
irrationals were more than a handful for mathematicians to contend with,
especially if they were unsure where they rightfully belonged.

The rational numbers, when expressed as decimals, either have a finite
decimal representation, like \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\)\footnote{To muddy
  matters even more, \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.4999\dots\) is an equally a valid
  representation!}, or an infinitely recurring decimal representation
like \(\frac{1}{3} = 0.333\dots\).

The irrational number \(\sqrt{2}\)---when expressed as a
decimal---neither terminates nor recurs without end. Its unpredictable
digits go on and on and on. So, where exactly does it sit on the real
line? This troubling question went unanswered until
\href{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dedekind-foundations/}{Richard
Dedekind} skilfully introduced the
\href{https://www.britannica.com/science/Dedekind-cut}{Dedekind cut} to
legitimately accommodate the irrationals as first-class citizens of the
real number line, fully capable of undergoing all the arithmetic
operations of the rational numbers.

The inclusion of the irrational numbers into the fold of real numbers
along with the rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\),
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers}{completes}
the set of real numbers, \(\mathbb{R}\), and helps lay the foundation
for rigour in analysis.

\subsection{Approximation of an
irrational}\label{approximation-of-an-irrational}

When we use a calculator to key in \(\sqrt{2}\), we see a sequence of
digits on the display. But that sequence is an \emph{approximation}.
\emph{The exact decimal representation of an irrational number does not
exist}. So, when we calculate or compute with irrationals, we are using
\emph{rational approximations} in their stead. And for real world
purposes, that approximation suffices.

A real sequence \(S(n)\), also written as \(S_{n}\), is a function from
the set of natural numbers to the set of real numbers. Symbolically,
this is stated as \(S: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\).

My calculator gives me the following approximation for \(\sqrt{2}\):
\(1.414213562\dots\). Suppose we form the sequence \[
S = (s_n) = 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, 1.41421, 1.414213, 1.4142135, 1.41421356, 1.414213562 \dots
\] obtained by truncating the decimal representation, with
\(s_{1} = 1\), \(s_{2} = 1.4\), until \(s_{9} = 1.41421356\). The
successive terms in the sequence are successive approximations to the
value \(\sqrt{2}\)---each more accurate than the previous one---but with
the proviso that there is no decimal representation for the \emph{exact}
value of \(\sqrt{2}\) except via the symbol itself.

Note the following points:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The sequence \(S\) goes on without end.
\item
  The sequence \(S\) has been constructed, one digit at a time, to
  approximate the value of \(\sqrt{2}\). Its terms therefore represent
  \emph{rational approximations} to \(\sqrt{2}\).
\item
  We may assert---by virtue of the construction of \(S\)---that a later
  term in the sequence is a more accurate approximation to \(\sqrt{2}\)
  than an earlier term. The sequence
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series}{converges} to
  \(\sqrt{2}\).
\item
  \(s_{n}\) \emph{tends to} the value \(\sqrt{2}\), as we keep on adding
  successive terms of the sequence.
\item
  Because \(s_{n}\) can never equal \(\sqrt{2}\), we \emph{cannot
  equate} \(s_{n}\) to \(\sqrt{2}\) for any \emph{finite}
  \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).
\item
  The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)}{limit} in
  this case, \(\sqrt{2}\), is therefore not a member of the sequence.
\end{enumerate}

In symbols, we write
\(s_{n} \to \sqrt{2} \text{ as } n \to \infty\).\footnote{Infinity is
  not a natural number.} Alternatively, we may write
\[\lim_{n \to \infty}s_{n} = \sqrt{2}.
\] But the equality sign here pertains to an \emph{infinite process} and
cannot be treated in the same cavalier way as we would the garden
variety equality sign in \(2 + 3 = 5\).

But this is imprecise because we are handwaving with the words ``tends
to'' indicated by \(\to\). We will re-visit the issue of how to make
precise and watertight the idea of a limit when we shed intuitive
notions like ``tends to'' and replace it with a strict arithmetical
criterion.

\subsection{Ordered Archimedean field}\label{ordered-archimedean-field}

Two properties of real numbers are highlighted as being essential for
real analysis:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_trichotomy}{trichotomy}
  of the real numbers, which states that every real number is either
  positive, zero, or negative. Given any two real numbers, \(x\) and
  \(y\), \emph{only one} of the following three statements is true:
  \(x < y\), or \(x = y\), or \(x > y\).
\item
  The \href{https://planetmath.org/archimedeanproperty}{Archimedean
  property} which forbids
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity}{infinities} and
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal}{infinitesimals}
  from being real numbers. It states that:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\roman{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For \emph{any} real number \(x\), there is a natural number \(n\)
    such that \(n > x\).\footnote{\(\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } n > x.\)}
  \item
    For \emph{any positive} real number \(y\), there is a natural number
    \(n\) such that \(\frac{1}{n} < y\).\footnote{\(\forall y \in \mathbb{R}, y > 0, \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } \frac{1}{n} < y\).}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inequalities and
distances}\label{inequalities-and-distances}

Calculus problems are generally concerned with \emph{evaluating} some
quantity and are therefore centred around \emph{equalities}.

Analysis, on the other hand, relies heavily on logical statements about
quantities whose exact values may not be known, but about whom
statements of \emph{relative size} need to be made. This is where
\emph{inequalities} enter the discourse.\footnote{You would have already
  seen from above how inequalities are used to define an Archimedean
  field.}

This change in emphasis can be disconcerting. Students seeking to
familiarize themselves with manipulations of inequalities should consult
entry-level texts dealing with this subject
{[}\citeproc{ref-kazarinoff-1961}{1}--\citeproc{ref-alsina-nelsen-2009}{3}{]}.

When the derivative was defined geometrically as the value of the slope
of a tangent to the graph of the function at a particular point, the
geometrical relationship alone sufficed to encapsulate the definition
and to help compute the value. XXX FIG

However, when the derivative is defined as a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)}{\emph{limit}},
using arithmetic instead of geometry, we do not have \emph{intuitive}
markers to guide us. And such markers are serviceable, but not
infallible. Therefore, we need some symbols and operations to contend
with ideas like the ``closeness'' of two points, etc.

This is where we encounter two mathematical devices quintessential to
analysis and much of modern mathematics:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Inequalities: by understanding and manipulating the symbols \(>\) and
  \(<\), we can work toward watertight definitions that serve to
  constrain what we are talking about. See \href{}{Spider in a matchbox}
  later on.
\item
  Distance: by using a sensible definition of the distance between two
  points, we may measure their ``closeness''. Geometry and intuition
  have been replaced by arithmetic and precision.

  If there are two \emph{distinct} real numbers \(x\) and \(y\),
  \(|x - y|\) defines the positive number that quantifies their
  separation or distance. Since we are on the real line, the
  \href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AbsoluteValue.html}{\emph{absolute
  value function}} is used for this purpose. XXX FIG

  The ``arbitrarily close'' condition of calculus is couched more
  precisely thus:

  \begin{quote}
  ``For arbitrary \(\varepsilon > 0\) and \(| x - y | < \varepsilon\)''.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

This incantation will become so familiar that it will become
unremarkable when you devote time and practice to analysis. And notice
the usefulness of inequalities here.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Approximation for \(\sqrt{2}\)
revisited}{Approximation for \textbackslash sqrt\{2\} revisited}}\label{approximation-for-sqrt2-revisited}

We now have a quantitative description for a measure of closeness. Let
us put it to use in the example from
\hyperref[approximation-of-an-irrational]{Approximation of an
irrational} above. We know that our approximation becomes better as
\(n\) increases.

Let us \emph{fix the admissible error} to be some positive real number
\(\varepsilon\). This means that the error is never zero: which is as
should be. We may then say that as long as \(n\) is larger than some
number, say \(m\), the error or difference between between \(s_{n}\) and
\(\sqrt{2}\) will be less than \(\varepsilon\).

To express this with few words and many symbols, we take recourse to two
ideas from logic:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  The
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification}{universal
  quantifier}, \(\forall\), which is spoken as ``for all'', ``for any'',
  or ``given any''.
\item
  The
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification}{existential
  quantifier}, \(\exists\), which is spoken, as ``there exists'',
  ``there is at least one'', or ``for some''.
\end{enumerate}

Strangely, these symbols generalize rather than particularize. So, how
do they tighten up and make more precise statements whose truth we wish
to establish? Along with inequalities, how do they help make precise the
notions that were handwaved away in calculus?

We may now precisely state:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:epsilon}{
\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}, \varepsilon > 0, \exists m \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } n > m \implies |S_{m} - \sqrt{2}| < \varepsilon.
}\end{equation}

This definition of a limit starts out with the error variable
\(\varepsilon\) rather than with the index \(m\), above which the error
is not exceeded. This may appear counter-intuitive, but if you think of
it like a shepherd does, you would want to corral your flock before
counting it.

The following points are noteworthy:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Apart from the limit, which in our case is \(\sqrt{2}\), there is no
  other specific value used in the definition.
\item
  We use an inequality in \(|s_{n} - \sqrt{2}| < \varepsilon\) because
  no term of \(S_{n}\) actually equals \(\sqrt{2}\).
\item
  By being silent on the value of \(\varepsilon\), except to require it
  to be positive, we may squeeze the error to as small as we want, and
  still not run afoul of any constraints regarding non-equality of any
  \(s_{n}\) with \(\sqrt{2}\). This formulation neatly encapsulates the
  notion of ``tends to'', or ``approaches'', ``but does not equal'',
  with a distance measure that may be made arbitrarily small, but not
  equal zero.\footnote{In hindsight, analysis started off as tidying up
    the loose ends of calculus, but ended up strengthening the whole
    edifice of mathematics, as its very foundations were impacted.}
\item
  The need for \(\mathbb{R}\) to be an
  \hyperref[ordered-archimedean-field]{Ordered Archimedean field} is
  apparent here. We have arbitrarily small numbers, but no
  infinitesimals, and there is no upper bound on the natural numbers.
\end{enumerate}

A pictorial illustration is given in \cref{fig:nested} of what is
happening on the real number line as we progressively approximate
\(\sqrt{2}\). The

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includesvg[width=0.9\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/nested-intervals.svg}
\caption{Nested sequences \([a_i, L]\) vis-a-vis the limit \(L\), which
represents \(\sqrt{2}\) in this case.}\label{fig:nested}
\end{figure}

Note that this figure is not to scale and is not of the actual values
given in \hyperref[approximation-of-an-irrational]{Approximation of an
irrational} but is rather an illustration of what happens as successive
approximations become progressively closer to the limit\footnote{This is
  purely didactic; otherwise, the later ticks would be overwitten and
  the later labels would obscure each other.}.

We know the the limit is \(\sqrt{2}\) because we constructed the
sequence so. Moreover, we are not approaching the limit from
\emph{above} but rather only from \emph{below} by using the successive
digits that the calculator spewed out.

The following observations apply to the
\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ClosedInterval.html}{closed
intervals}, \([a_1, L]\), \([a_2, L]\), \([a_3, L]\), \([a_4, L]\):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \(L\), representing \(\sqrt{2}\), is the \emph{upper bound} of all the
  intervals. We do not exceed \(L\) as we are approaching it from below.
  Note also that we may include \(\sqrt{2}\) as the end point of a
  closed interval in the real line, like \([a_1, \sqrt{2}]\), because
  the irrationals are first-class citizens of the real line.
\item
  As we move from \(a_1\) to \(a_4\), the intervals \([a_i, L]\), keep
  getting smaller.
\item
  The intervals are
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_intervals}{nested}:
  \([a_1, L] \supset [a_2, L] \supset [a_3, L] \supset [a_4, L]\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Nested sequences}\label{nested-sequences}

When a limit is approached from above as well as below, the inclusion of
successive intervals, one in the other is more apparent. The limit \(L\)
would then be contained in the interval that is the \emph{set
intersection} of all the intervals.

We start with the outermost closed interval \([a_1, b_1]\), and progress
through \([a_2, b_2]\), \([a_3, b_3]\), and \([a_4, b_4]\), as
illustrated in \cref{fig:nested-bilateral}.

interval.}\label{fig:nested-bilateral}

For those seeking a concrete metaphor for this abstract ``intervals on
the real line'' image,
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll}{Matryoshka dolls,
or Russian dolls}, are a very serviceable, accurate, and unforgettable
metaphor, as shown in \cref{fig:matryoshka}.

\subsection{Cauchy sequence}\label{cauchy-sequence}

A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence}{Cauchy sequence}
is a sequence of numbers whose terms are spaced apart more and more
closely as the sequence progresses. In symbols, if the sequence is
denoted by \(S = (a_n)\), then \[
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } n > N \text{ and } m > N \implies |a_n - a_m| < \varepsilon.
\] This ``bunching'' property of later terms in the sequence is
intuitively reassuring, as it is what we would expect when a sequence
converges. It is also a necessary and sufficient condition for a
sequence to converge to a limit.

\subsection{In Retrospect}\label{in-retrospect}

There has been a fair bit of huffing and puffing to get to this point.
Has it been worth it?

We have laid a strong foundation for the real numbers by including the
irrationals, circumventing infinitesimals, and defining a limit without
using ideas from time and space, but rather using measures of distance,
and inequalities to denote vanishingly small quantities that,
nevertheless, do not ever equal zero. If you think that this is all
\href{https://www.powerthesaurus.org/much_ado_about_nothing/synonyms}{much
ado about nothing} then, you are unlikely to appreciate analysis any
further.
\href{https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/adios\%20amigo}{Adios
Amigo!}

But if you think that the view from the top was worth the slog of the
climb, you will be better placed to appreciate how differentiation,
integration, and Fourier analysis benefited from the thorough renovation
of the foundations of mathematics that led to analysis. These will be
the subjects of future blogs.

\subsection{Limits: conceptually and
rigorously}\label{limits-conceptually-and-rigorously}

One interesting feature of limits for functions is that \emph{a limit at
a point may exist even if the function is not defined at that particular
point}. The definition of a limit therefore requires closeness to the
point but \emph{not equality} to the point.

\subsection{Recommended core texts on
analysis}\label{recommended-core-texts-on-analysis}

I am aware of three classic two-volume texts that are held in high
esteem by the mathematical community. The authors of these texts have
taken pains to make the material accessible to students commencing
analysis courses. The texts are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Richard Courant and Fritz John: \emph{Introduction to Calculus and
  Analysis, Volumes I and II}, 1989. This is a classic from a different
  vintage that has stood the test of time. It is more generously
  illustrated than most analysis texts
  {[}\citeproc{ref-courant-john-one}{4},\citeproc{ref-courant-john-two}{5}{]}.
\item
  Terence Tao: \emph{Analysis I} and \emph{Analysis II}, 2022. This
  text, especially the first volume, was especially written to ease
  students into analysis. It could have as well been called ``Analysis
  from Scratch''. It is a well-paced, student-friendly text, where the
  author has taken pains to explain issues, as if talking to a beginner
  student.
  {[}\citeproc{ref-tao-one-2022}{6},\citeproc{ref-tao-two-2022}{7}{]}.
\item
  Vladimir A Zorich: \emph{Analysis I} and \emph{Analysis II}, 2015 and
  2016. These are translations of the original texts in Russian. Besides
  rigour, these texts are grounded in actual applications of analysis,
  and should appeal to physicists and engineers
  {[}\citeproc{ref-zorich-one-2015}{8},\citeproc{ref-zorich-two-2016}{9}{]}.
\end{enumerate}

You, the student must find out which author's writing resonates best
with you, and use that text as your anchor text. For instance, I used
Maxwell Rosenlicht's \emph{Introduction to Analysis}
{[}\citeproc{ref-rosenlicht1986}{10}{]} when I encountered analysis for
the first time, because I found it easier to follow than the recommended
text. Choose whatever book serves you best to achieve your goals.

\subsection{Irrational numbers as
reals}\label{irrational-numbers-as-reals}

Irrationals were never properly integrated into the real numbers until
That is not a story we will visit today, except to say that
strengthening the foundations of the real numbers was a necessary
prerequisite that laid the foundations of analysis. Numbers such as
\(\pi\) and \(\sqrt{2}\) arising from the simplest plane geometry can
now be accommodated legitimately as first-class citizens of the real
number line.

\subsection{The reals as an ordered Archimedean
field}\label{the-reals-as-an-ordered-archimedean-field}

\subsection{Nested sequences in the real line and Matrioshka
dolls}\label{nested-sequences-in-the-real-line-and-matrioshka-dolls}

wavelets{]}}\label{nested-intervals-and-matrioshka-dolls-also-wavelets}

\subsection{Infinite processes and
infinities}\label{infinite-processes-and-infinities}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The idea of \emph{closeness} in arithmetic
terms:
\(| a_n - a_m | < \varepsilon\)}{The idea of closeness in arithmetic terms: \textbar{} a\_n - a\_m \textbar{} \textless{} \textbackslash varepsilon}}\label{the-idea-of-closeness-in-arithmetic-terms-a_n---a_m-varepsilon}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Real numbers: holes in the number line

  Infinite Processes and Infinities
\item
  No geometry
\item
  No algebra
\item
  But arithmetic

\item
  Pathological functions
\item
  Fourier Series: how can a curvy function produce a square wave?
\item
  My selection of books
\item
  Extract from chapter
\item
  Order in the field of real numbers; Is the Complex field ordered?
\item
  Modulus function to define length
\item
  Approximation rather than Computation
\item
  Why Differentiation need s to be re-defined
\item
  Why Integration needs to be redefined
\item
  What happens at Infinity? Is the equals sign really valid?
\end{enumerate}

Tao I: Quote Since differential and integral calculus is also intimately
tied up with geometry---think of slopes of tangents, or areas under a
curve---calculus also requires the real number system in order to
function properly.
