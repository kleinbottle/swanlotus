## "I made a wager"

"I made a wager", my friend Solus "Sol" Simkin opened up the other day. We were enjoying the warmth of a spring afternoon, with just the right balance of light and shade, just the right balance of heat and cold, and a humidity that could have descended from Heaven. I might have slipped into the delicious oblivion of sleep, were it not for the fact that I cherished hearing Sol, even more than I desired sleep. So, I was all agog to hear him regale yet another tale from his intellectual adventures.
