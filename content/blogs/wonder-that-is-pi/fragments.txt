What does the equality sign mean for an infinite sum? How can a sum of rationals equal an irrational number? A transcendental number? The meaning of $=$ is therefore not in the sense of $2 + 2 = 4$ or even of $x - 5 = 0$. It is something similar and yet something different, because, despite Cantor, we have not tamed the idea of infinity yet.

## Newton, the Binomial Theorem, and Pi

[Isaac Newton](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton/) contributed singularly to mathematics, physics, and astronomy, even as Archimedes did. So, it is not surprising that he too participated in the quest for $\pi$. He sought an efficient algorithm that would yield the most accuracy with the least number of terms. In this, he succeeded.

Existing accounts vary as to how exactly he derived better approximations to $\pi$. Some accounts claim that he used the binomial theorem to simplify inverse sine series.

REALLY NEED TO CLEAN THIS UP.



Newton discovered the [binomial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem) for integer powers, but which he pressed into service to deal with negative and non-integral powers, as well. He was also aware that $\pi$ lurked openly in the trigonometric functions, or more precisely, in the _inverse_ trigonometric functions. We have already seen how the Madhava-Gregory-Leibnitz series is based on the inverse tangent or arctangent function. Newton used the inverse sine function.

The derivative of the sine function is another trigonometric function, the cosine function. But the derivative of the _inverse_ sine function is not trigonometric, but algebraic. This means that working on the inverse trigonometric functions opens a window into the use of algebraic manipulations such as are afforded by the binomial theorem.

Newton exploited this feature to get better estimates of $\pi$ with less effort. The two equations we should keep in mind are that $\sin\frac{\pi}{2} = 1$ and $\sin\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$. This in turn means that $\arcsin{1} = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\arcsin\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi}{6}$. The derivative of the inverse sine function is given by [@libre-inv-trig-deriv]:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\arcsin x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
$$ {#eq:arcsine-deriv} or eqivalently
$$
\int{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}} = \arcsin x + C
$$ {#eq:arcsine-int} where $C$ is the constant of integration.
Now, the integrand on the LHS (left hand side) of [@eq:arcsine-int] may be written, using the binomial theorem, as
$$
\left( 1 - x^2 \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \dots
$$

Newton leveraged the "nice" values $\sin\frac{\pi}{2} = 1$ and $\sin\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$  in his algorithms. Again this is "starting from the known to venture into the unknown". Let $\sin y = x \implies y = \arcsin x$. We have:


used the binomial theorem to derive:
$$
\begin{array}{lcl}
\arcsin x & = & x + \frac{1}{2}\frac{x^3}{3} + 
\frac{1\cdot 3}{2\cdot 4}\frac{x^5}{5} + \dots \\[0.5em]
%\mbox{for which, substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ gives} & & \\
\pi & = & 6\left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3 \cdot 2^3} + 
\frac{1 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 4}\frac{1}{5 \cdot 2^5} + \dots\right)
\end{array}
$$ {#eq:binomial}


(1+x)n = 1 + nx + n(n-1)x2/2! + n(n-1)(n-2)x3/3! + ...
