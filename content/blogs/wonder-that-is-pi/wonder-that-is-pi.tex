This is a sequel to the blog
\href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/the-pi-of-archimedes}{``The Pi
of Archimedes''}. Here, we look at π as a number---without explicit
reference to its geometric tethering---and explore its remarkable
ubiquity in mathematics. As an appetizer, see \cref{fig:pi-equations},
where the symbol for Pi is surmounted by two very disparate equations
defining it. How in all the world could these two different-looking
equations be true? But they are indeed!

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The Number
\href{https://www.thefreedictionary.com/menagerie}{Menagerie}}{The Number Menagerie}}\label{the-number-menagerie}

Numbers may be compared to animals in a zoo. Each is different, and yet
they all share some attributes in common. The variety and diversity of
zoo animals can be challenging. That is why the big cats are grouped
together, the herbivores live in another part of the zoo, etc.

Numbers, like animals, have evolved over many centuries into what I call
the \emph{number menagerie}. A very elementary picture of this zoo is
outlined in my blog
\href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/the-two-most-important-numbers-zero-and-one}{``The
Two Most Important Numbers: Zero and One''} in case you need to review
some definitions.

To appreciate \(\pi\) as a number, we need to be aware of the
\href{https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy}{taxonomy} in the zoo
of numbers. It turns out that \emph{\(\pi\) is a real number that is
transcendental and therefore also irrational}. Let us make a short
detour to better understand what this means.

\subsubsection{Real and Complex Numbers}\label{real-and-complex-numbers}

There are two major sets of numbers: real numbers, denoted by the set
\(\mathbb{R}\), and complex numbers, denoted by the set \(\mathbb{C}\).
The difference between the two is that while a real number is a single
number, a complex number is a pair, composed of two real numbers,
conjoined by the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit}{imaginary unit}
\(i\), where \(i^2 = -1\). In set-theoretic notation, we write \[
\mathbb{C} = \{a + bi: a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}.
\] Sometimes, the complex number \(a + bi\) is written as the ordered
pair \((a, b)\), provided the context is clear.

What then are the reals? The real numbers are the union of the set of
rational numbers and the irrational numbers. Alternatively, the reals
are the union of the algebraic numbers and the transcendental
numbers.\footnote{Since both algebraic and transcendental numbers can be
  complex, we need the added condition that these do not involve the
  imaginary unit, \(i\). For example,
  \((1 + \frac{\sqrt{(-7)}}{2}) = (1 + \frac{\sqrt{7}}{2}i)\), and
  \(\pi i\) are examples of algebraic and transcendental numbers
  respectively that involve \(i\).}

We will define each of these terms below and how they relate to one
another. As always, we start with the known and proceed to the unknown.

\subsubsection{The Integers and Friends}\label{the-integers-and-friends}

The set \(\mathbb{N}\) of \emph{natural or counting numbers} is defined
as \[
\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n, n+1, \dots\}.
\] It is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set}{countably
infinite} set whose members begin with \(1\) and progress by the
addition of \(1\) to the predecessor. It is an infinite set, which means
it never ends, as denoted by the
\href{https://www.grammarly.com/blog/ellipsis/}{ellipsis} or dots at the
end of the definition.

Zero is not a natural number and is assigned its own, unnamed set,
\(\{0\}\).\footnote{Some folks include zero in \(\mathbb{N}\).}

The set of \emph{integers} \(\mathbb{Z}\) includes the negative numbers,
zero, and the positive numbers: \[
\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}
\] Like \(\mathbb{N}\), \(\mathbb{Z}\) is also a countably infinite set.

\subsection{A first dichotomy}\label{a-first-dichotomy}

The real numbers may be partitioned into subsets in different ways: one
way is into the \emph{rational} and \emph{irrational} numbers.

Every real number is \emph{either} rational or irrational. If the
universe of discourse is the real number set, the rational and
irrational numbers are complements of each other. In other words, the
\emph{union} of the set of rational numbers and the set of irrational
numbers \emph{is} the set of real numbers.

\subsection{Rational Numbers}\label{rational-numbers}

The \emph{rational numbers} are denoted by the set \(\mathbb{Q}\)
defined to be: \[
\mathbb{Q} = \{\tfrac{a}{b} \mbox{ where } a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \mbox{ and } b \neq 0\}.
\] The condition imposed on \(b\) arises from the stricture that
division by zero is not permitted among the integers and
reals.\footnote{See
  \href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/the-two-most-important-numbers-zero-and-one}{``The
  Two Most Important Numbers: Zero and One''} for the reason why.}

Let us amplify the consequences of these definitions. Is the number
\(25\) rational? Yes, indeed. But where is the denominator? It is
\emph{implicit} and equals \(1\). The fact that \[
25 = \frac{25}{1}
\] makes it clear that \(25\) is a rational number. Every integer is a
rational number.

And it is obvious from the definition that \(\frac{2}{3}\) is a rational
number. But is \(-\frac{11}{16}\) a rational number? Yes, indeed,
because the definition depends upon the \emph{integer} \(a\) and the
\emph{non-zero integer} \(b\), where both integers---being drawn from
\(\mathbb{Z}\)---can be signed.

When a rational number is expressed as a decimal, that decimal can
either terminate or recur without end.

For example, the fraction \(\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3}\) has a
recurring decimal representation as revealed by division. The line on
top indicates the portion of the decimal which recurs---in this case, it
is the single digit \(3\).

When we look at the fraction \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\), we have an example
of a terminating decimal. We could, however, pad zeros after the first
decimal place, and claim that even a terminating decimal is recurring;
witness that \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 = 0.5000 \dots = 0.5\overline{0}\). But
that is not the whole story.

We can further show that: \[
\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 = 0.5\overline{0} = 0.4\overline{9}.
\] It does seem strange to claim that two different decimals can express
the \emph{same} rational number \(\frac{1}{2}\).

To see why, let us rewrite \(0.4\overline{9}\) as
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:recur}{
\begin{aligned}
0.4\overline{9} = 0.4999\dots &= \frac{4}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{9}{1000} + \frac{9}{10000}\dots\\
&= \frac{4}{10} + 9\left[ \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{10000} \dots\right]\\
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation} Consider now the expression in square brackets on the
right hand side (RHS) of \cref{eq:recur}. We can recognize it as a
\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeometricSeries.html}{geometric
series} with first term \(a = \frac{1}{100}\) and common ratio
\(r = \frac{1}{10}\). Since \(r < 1\), the series is \emph{convergent}
and its
\href{https://senecalearning.com/en-GB/revision-notes/a-level/maths/edexcel/pure-maths/4-2-9-sum-to-infinity-of-a-geometric-series}{sum
to infinity} {[}\citeproc{ref-seneca}{1}{]} is given by:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:sum}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a}{1 - r} &= \frac{\frac{1}{100}}{[1 - \frac{1}{10}]}\\
&= \frac{\left[\frac{1}{100}\right]}{\left[\frac{9}{10}\right]}\\
&= \left[\tfrac{1}{100}\right] \left[\tfrac{10}{9}\right]\\
& = \tfrac{1}{90}.
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation} Substituting for the terms in square brackets in
\cref{eq:recur}, we get \[
0.4\overline{9} = \frac{4}{10} + 9\left[\frac{1}{90}\right] = \frac{4}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}.
\] Even if it seems counter-intuitive that
\(0.4\overline{9} = 0.5 = 0.5\overline{0} = \frac{1}{2}\), it is
mathematically consistent and correct. One may therefore hazard a guess,
and correctly so, that \emph{every rational number may be expressed as a
recurring decimal}.\footnote{In this case either the digit \(9\) or the
  digit \(0\) recurs.}

Infinite sums have this property of upending our ``intuition'' about
what is correct. So, we have to be extra careful when dealing with the
value of a limit as some variable goes to infinity. Moreover, infinity,
represented by \(\infty\) is \emph{not} a number and cannot be treated
as one. It is simply a convenient shorthand symbol. This caveat should
be kept in mind when we encounter infinite sums involving \(\pi\), as
shown for example, in \cref{fig:pi-equations}.

\subsection{Irrational Numbers}\label{irrational-numbers}

Irrational numbers are numbers which are \emph{not rational}. The
discovery that \(\sqrt{2}\)---which is the length of the diagonal of a
unit square---was not rational
{[}\citeproc{ref-HSM-SE}{2},\citeproc{ref-clegg2004}{3}{]}, caused the
first ripples of disquiet in the ancient mathematical world, because it
upset the prevailing philosophy that ratios of whole numbers alone ruled
the world.

There are many celebrated proofs that \(\sqrt{2}\) is not the ratio of
two integers and is therefore irrational
{[}\citeproc{ref-bogomolny2018}{4}{]}. Nevertheless, it took almost two
millennia for \(\sqrt{2}\) to be accepted into the fold of properly
defined numbers {[}\citeproc{ref-cepelewicz2024}{5}{]}.

An irrational number like \(\sqrt{2}\) does not have any recurring
sequence of digits when expressed as a decimal. But the absence of
recurring sequences in the decimal representation of a number should not
solely be used to identify a number as irrational, because some
rationals with large denominators can and do have very long recurring
sequences, which may be difficult to detect by visual inspection . For
example, \(\frac{8119}{5741}\)---which incidentally is a rational
approximation to \(\sqrt{2}\)---has a recurring sequence of length
\(5740\).\footnote{Also called the \emph{period} of a repeating decimal.
  See \url{https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=8119\%2F5741}.}

\subsubsection{The irrationals exceed in number the
rationals}\label{the-irrationals-exceed-in-number-the-rationals}

If you are curious, you might wonder which are the more numerous: the
rationals or the irrationals. You might guess that the familiar
rationals are more numerous than the obscure irrationals. But you would
be mistaken.

In fact,
\href{https://socratic.org/questions/58c80a37b72cff29df40c794}{the
irrationals far exceed in number the rational numbers}
{[}\citeproc{ref-socratic}{6}{]}. This fact is stated baldly here,
because going into the whys and wherefores of this claim will lead us
too far astray from our focus on \(\pi\). It is an interesting fact,
though, that you should stash away for future use.

\subsection{A second dichotomy}\label{a-second-dichotomy}

The real numbers may also be split another way into two mutually
exclusive sets: the \emph{algebraic numbers} and the
\emph{transcendental numbers}. Every real number is \emph{either} an
algebraic number or a transcendental number; it cannot be both.

It bears noting though, that both the algebraic and the transcendental
numbers may be complex, i.e, have an imaginary part. But in this blog,
we have restricted our universe to the real numbers. In this blog, we
will not consider algebraic or transcendental numbers that embody the
imaginary unit.

\subsection{The Algebraic Numbers}\label{the-algebraic-numbers}

An algebraic number is the root of a non-zero polynomial with integer or
rational coefficients. Things have gotten abstract enough thus far for
eyes to be glazed. So, let us invoke some examples to revive attention.

The simplest algebraic number is an integer. Let us take \(5\) as an
example. If the polynomial \(p(x) = x - 5\), its root is when
\(p(x) = 0\), i.e., when \(x - 5 = 0\). This implies \(x = 5\) and we
have shown that \(5\) is algebraic \emph{by definition}.

Note that we could have used any other polynomial with the same root,
such as \(q(x) = 2x - 10\). All we need do is find \emph{one} polynomial
whose root equals the number and we have shown that the number is
algebraic.

Likewise, the rational number \(-(\frac{2}{3})\) is the root of the
polynomial \(3x + 2\) and is therefore algebraic.

We may assert that \emph{every rational number is algebraic and
therefore not transcendental}.

But what about an irrational number like \(\sqrt{2}\)? Is it algebraic?
The polynomial \((x^2 - 2)\) has a zeros at \(\pm\sqrt{2}\), thereby
demonstrating that both \(\pm\sqrt{2}\) are algebraic.

Can an algebraic number be a complex root of a real polynomial? Let us
find the roots for the real polynomial \(x^2 - 10x +34\): \[
\begin{aligned}
x^2 - 10x + 34 &= 0\\
(x^2 -10x + 25) + 9 &= 0\\
(x - 5)^2 + 9 = 0\\
(x - 5)^2 &= -9\\
(x - 5) &= \pm3i\\
x &= 5 \pm 3i\\
\end{aligned}
\] We have just shown that an algebraic number can be a complex root of
a real polynomial. While we will not consider complex algebraic numbers
in this blog, it is useful to know that they do exist.

\subsection{The Transcendental
Numbers}\label{the-transcendental-numbers}

Numbers which are \emph{not algebraic} are assigned the rather exalted
title of transcendental numbers. But proving that a particular number is
transcendental is no mean task. We will accept a number as
transcendental if it has been proved to be so by professional
mathematicians. Numbers like
\href{https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=is+pi+transcendental}{\(\pi\)},
\href{https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=is+e+transcendental}{\(e\)},
and
\href{https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=is+ln\%282\%29+transcendental}{\(\ln 2\)}
are transcendental.

\emph{All transcendental numbers are perforce irrational}.

Transcendental numbers can also be complex, but we will steer clear of
that category here, because we don't want to get more dizzy
(mathematically) than we already are right now! \emojifont {😉}
\normalfont.

\subsection{Taxonomy via Tetrachotomy}\label{taxonomy-via-tetrachotomy}

We have established a
\href{https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/tetrachotomy}{tetrachotomy}
among the real numbers. But the four parts are not mutually exclusive.
They overlap. There are two non-overlapping dichotomies: the rationals
and irrationals as one pair, and the algebraic and transcendental
numbers as the other.

It is noteworthy that irrational numbers like \(\sqrt{2}\) and
transcendental numbers like \(\pi\) and \(e\) are denoted, not by
values, but by \emph{symbols}.

This classification of the real numbers seems to be crying out for a
Venn diagram to depict it visually. But before we do that, let us
marshal the facts we have gathered so far:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The real numbers are represented by the standard set \(\mathbb{R}\).
\item
  The rationals are represented by the standard set \(\mathbb{Q}\).
\item
  There is no assigned symbol for the set of irrationals. Because it is
  the set difference between the reals and the rationals, it is often
  denoted as \(\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}\). But this notation is
  cumbersome. So, let us define a non-standard set \(\mathbb{I}\) and
  let it stand for the irrationals:
  \(\mathbb{I} = \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}\).
\item
  Let us introduce the non-standard symbol \(\mathbb{A_{\mathbb{R}}}\)
  for the set of real algebraic numbers.
\item
  Let us introduce the non-standard symbol \(\mathbb{T_{\mathbb{R}}}\)
  for the set of real transcendental numbers.
\item
  The real numbers are the union of the rational and the irrational
  numbers: \(\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{I}\).
\item
  The real numbers are also the union of the algebraic and
  transcendental numbers that do not embody the imaginary unit \(i\):
  \(\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{A_{\mathbb{R}}} \cup \mathbb{T_{\mathbb{R}}}\)
\item
  Algebraic numbers can be either rational or irrational:
  \(\mathbb{A_{\mathbb{R}}} \subseteq (\mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{I})\).
\item
  All rational numbers are algebraic:
  \(\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{A_{\mathbb{R}}}\)
\item
  No rational number is transcendental:
  \(\mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{T_{\mathbb{R}}} = \emptyset\)
\item
  All real transcendental numbers are irrational:
  \(\mathbb{T_{\mathbb{R}}} \subset \mathbb{I}\).
\item
  The irrational numbers contain \emph{all} transcendental numbers and a
  subset of the algebraic numbers, again excluding those that embody
  \(i\):
  \((\mathbb{T_{\mathbb{R}}} \subset \mathbb{I}) \wedge (\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}} \cap \mathbb{I} \neq \emptyset)\).
\end{enumerate}

That was quite mouthful even with mathematical symbols. We are now ready
to draw the Venn diagram for the tetrachotomy of the real numbers.

And surprise! surprise! There are only \emph{three} regions in the Venn
diagram that are populated. So, taking mathematical liberties, we may
say that our tetrachotomy was not ``linearly independent''.

\(\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{A_{\mathbb{R}}} \cup \mathbb{I}\). Note where
\(\pi\) resides, and also that there are only \emph{three} populated
regions in the Venn diagram: \(\mathbb{Q}\),
\((\mathbb{A_{\mathbb{R}}} \cap \mathbb{I})\), and
\(\mathbb{T_{\mathbb{R}}}\).}\label{fig:venn}

\subsection{Enter π}\label{enter-ux3c0}

We have gone through all this huffing and puffing to place \(\pi\)
contextually among the real numbers. Let us list its characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  It is not a rational number, which means that it cannot be expressed
  as the ratio of two whole numbers, the denominator being non-zero.
\item
  Its decimal representation is neither finite nor does it contain a
  recurring segment, regardless of how long the decimal is.
\item
  It is also not the root to any non-zero polynomial equation whose
  coefficients are integers or rational numbers.
\item
  When Pi is used in equations, the placeholder symbol \(\pi\) is used.
\end{enumerate}

These properties have earned for \(\pi\) the rather exalted title of
transcendental number, which it shares with other pivotal numbers like
\(e\). Pi is not only important, it is also tantalizing. Pi is like a
beautiful butterfly that cannot be caught in the net of finitude. It is
like a rainbow that is beautiful to behold from afar, but can never be
reached.

One could almost say that \(\pi\) is not numerically friendly. And you
would not be too wrong. Rational approximations for \(\pi\), like
\(\frac{22}{7}\), are used in practice. And the matter would have rested
there were it not for the human quest for beauty.

The unpredictability of successive decimal places of \(\pi\) has
enchanted mathematicians and still continues to engross them. Pi has
been calculated to an unprecedented number of decimal places, and such a
quest is certainly driven, not by practical necessity, but possibly by
the need for aesthetic fulfilment.

This quest for the unattainable---but supremely beautiful---has engaged
human minds to seek \(\pi\) in countless infinite sums, such are shown
in \cref{fig:pi-equations}. These equations are sometimes starkly simple
and at other times thoroughly mystifying, and embody the paradox that is
\(\pi\) more succinctly than all the words in the world.

\subsection{Madhava-Gregory series}\label{madhava-gregory-series}

What does the equality sign mean for an infinite sum? How can a sum of
rationals equal and irrational number? A transcendental number? The
meaning of \(=\) is therefore not in the sense of \(2 + 2 = 4\) or even
of \(x - 5 = 0\). It is something similar and yet something different,
because, despite Cantor, we have not tamed the idea of infinity yet.
