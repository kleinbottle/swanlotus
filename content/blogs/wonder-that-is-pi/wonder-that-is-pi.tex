This is a sequel to the blog
\href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/the-pi-of-archimedes}{``The Pi
of Archimedes''}. Here, we look at π as a number---without explicit
reference to its geometric tethering---and explore its remarkable
ubiquity in mathematics. As an appetizer, see \cref{fig:pi-equations},
where the symbol for Pi is surmounted by two very disparate equations
defining it. How in all the world could these two different-looking
equations be true? But they are indeed!

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The Number
\href{https://www.thefreedictionary.com/menagerie}{Menagerie}}{The Number Menagerie}}\label{the-number-menagerie}

Numbers may be compared to animals in a zoo. Each is different, and yet
they all share some things in common. The variety and diversity of zoo
animals can be challenging. That is why the big cats are grouped
together, the herbivores live in another part of the zoo, etc.

Numbers, like animals, have evolved over many centuries into what I call
the \emph{number menagerie}. A very elementary picture of this zoo is
outlined in my blog
\href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/the-two-most-important-numbers-zero-and-one}{``The
Two Most Important Numbers: Zero and One''} in case you need to review
some definitions.

To appreciate \(\pi\) as a number, we need to be aware of the
\hyperref[taxonomy]{taxonomy} in the zoo of numbers. It turns out that
\(\pi\) is a real number that is transcendental and therefore also
irrational. Let us pause for a while to better understand what this
means.

\subsubsection{Real and Complex Numbers}\label{real-and-complex-numbers}

Broadly speaking, there are two classes of numbers: real numbers,
denoted by the set \(\mathbb{R}\), and complex numbers, denoted by the
set \(\mathbb{C}\). The difference between the two is that while a real
number is a single number, a complex number is a pair, composed of two
real numbers, conjoined by the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit}{imaginary unit}
\(i\), where \(i^2 = -1\). In set-theoretic notation, we write
\[\mathbb{C} = \{a + ib: a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}.
\]

What then are the reals? We will leave that question aside for the
moment, and look instead into what undivided or whole numbers are.

\subsubsection{The Integers and Friends}\label{the-integers-and-friends}

The set \(\mathbb{N}\) of \emph{natural or counting numbers} is defined
as \[
\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n, n+1, \dots\}.
\] It is a \emph{countably infinite} set whose members begin with \(1\)
and progress by the addition of \(1\) to the predecessor. It goes on
without end.

Zero is not a natural number and is assigned its own unnamed set,
\(\{0\}\).\footnote{Some folks include zero in \(\mathbb{N}\).}

The set of \emph{integers} \(\mathbb{Z}\) includes the negative numbers,
zero, and the positive numbers: \[
\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}
\] Like \(\mathbb{N}\), \(\mathbb{Z}\) is also a countably infinite set.

\subsubsection{Rational and Irrational
Numbers}\label{rational-and-irrational-numbers}

Every real number is \emph{either} rational or irrational. If the
universe of discourse is the real number set, the rational and
irrational numbers are complements of each other. In other words, the
\emph{union} of the set of rational numbers and the set of irrational
numbers \emph{is} the set of real numbers.

The rational numbers are denoted by the set \(\mathbb{Q}\) defined to
be: \[
\mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{a}{b} \mbox{ where } a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \mbox{ and } b \neq 0\}.
\] The condition imposed on \(b\) arises from the stricture that
division by zero is not permitted among the integers and
reals.\footnote{See
  \href{https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/the-two-most-important-numbers-zero-and-one}{``The
  Two Most Important Numbers: Zero and One''} for the reason why.}

A number that is not rational is an irrational number.

Let us amplify the consequences of these definitions. Is the number
\(25\) rational? Yes, indeed. But where is the denominator? It is
\emph{implicit} and equals \(1\). The fact that \[
25 = \frac{25}{1}.
\] makes it clear that \(25\) is a rational number.

And it is obvious from the definition that \(\frac{2}{3}\) is a rational
number. But is \(-\frac{11}{16}\) a rational number? Indeed, because the
definition draws upon the \emph{integer} \(a\) and the \emph{non-zero
integer} \(b\), where an integer can be signed.

Irrational numbers are numbers which are \emph{not rational}. The
discovery that \(\sqrt{2}\)---which is the length of the diagonal of a
unit square---was not rational, caused the first ripples of disquiet in
the ancient mathematical world, because it upset the prevailing
philosophy that whole numbers alone ruled the world.

Let us also be aware that when a number is expressed in decimal form,
the rationals take the form of terminating decimals or of recurring
decimals. For example, \[
\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 = 0.4\overline{9}.
\] The expression \(0.4\overline{9}\) means that the digit \(9\) keeps
repeating indefinitely. It might seem strange that two slightly
different decimals express the same rational number \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Let us rewrite \(0.4\overline{9}\) as
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:recur}{
\begin{aligned}
0.4\overline{9} = 0.4999\dots &= \frac{4}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{9}{1000} + \dots\\
&= \frac{4}{10} + 9\left[ \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{1000} + \dots\right]\\
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation} Consider now the expression in square brackets in
\cref{eq:recur}. We can recognize it as a
\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeometricSeries.html}{geometric
series} with first term \(a = \frac{1}{100}\) and common ratio
\(r = \frac{1}{10} < 1\). The
\href{https://senecalearning.com/en-GB/revision-notes/a-level/maths/edexcel/pure-maths/4-2-9-sum-to-infinity-of-a-geometric-series}{sum
to infinity} of this \emph{convergent} geometric series is given by
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq:sum}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a}{1 - r} &= \frac{\frac{1}{100}}{[1 - \frac{1}{10}]}\\
&= \frac{\left[\frac{1}{100}\right]}{\left[\frac{9}{10}\right]}\\
&= \left[\tfrac{1}{100}\right] \left[\tfrac{10}{9}\right]\\
& = \tfrac{1}{90}.
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation} Substituting for the second term in \cref{eq:recur}, we
get \[
0.4\overline{9} = \frac{4}{10} + 9\left[\frac{1}{90}\right] = \frac{4}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}.
\] Even if it seems counter-intuitive that
\(0.4\overline{9} = 0.5 = 0.5\overline{0} = \frac{1}{2}\), it is
mathematically consistent and correct. For another example, the fraction
\(\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3}\) also has a recurring decimal
representation. One may therefore hazard a guess, and correctly so, that
\emph{every rational number may be expressed as a recurring
decimal}.\footnote{In this case either the digit \(9\) or the digit
  \(0\) recurs.}

Infinite sums have this property of upending our ``intuition'' about
what is correct. So, we have to be extra careful when dealing with the
value of a limit as some variable goes to infinity. Moreover, infinity,
represented by \(\infty\) is \emph{not} a number and cannot be treated
as one. It is simply a convenient shorthand symbol. This caveat should
be kept in mind when we encounter infinite sums involving \(\pi\), as
shown for example, in \cref{fig:pi-equations}.

An irrational number like \(\sqrt{2}\) does not have any recurring
sequence of digits when expressed as a decimal. But the absence of
recurring sequences in the decimal representation of a number should not
solely be used to identify a number as irrational, because some
rationals with large denominators can and do have very long recurring
sequences, which may be difficult to detect by visual inspection. For
example, \(\frac{8119}{5741}\), which is a rational approximation to
\(\sqrt{2}\), has a recurring sequence of length \(5740\).\footnote{Also
  called the \emph{period} of a repeating decimal.}

\subsubsection{Algebraic and Transcendental
Numbers}\label{algebraic-and-transcendental-numbers}

Another dichotomy that may be applied to the real numbers is to
segregate them into two classes of numbers: the algebraic numbers and
the transcendental numbers. There is one complication: both algebraic
and transcendental numbers may be complex. But if we restrict our
universe to the real numbers, then these two sets are disjoint, i.e.,
they do not overlap.

An algebraic number is the root of a non-zero polynomial with integer or
rational coefficients. Things have gotten abstract enough thus far for
eyes to be glazed. So, let us invoke some examples to revive attention.

We will steer clear of transcendental numbers that are complex because
we don't want to get dizzy right at the beginning \emojifont {😉}
\normalfont.

Real Rational Integer Irrational Algebraic Transcendental Complex etc.

Hark back to

Venn diagram showing the number taxonomy can be challenging
\href{https://mathmonks.com/transcendental-numbers}{Venn diagram is
shown here}. This Venn diagram is flawed.

\subsubsection{Taxonomy}\label{taxonomy}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The real numbers are a union of the algebraic and transcendental
  numbers.
\item
  The algebraic numbers can be either rational or irrational.
\item
  All rational numbers are algebraic.
\item
  No rational number is transcendental.
\item
  All real transcendental numbers are irrational.
\item
  The irrational numbers contain \emph{all} transcendental numbers ad a
  subset of the algebraic numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Madhava-Gregory series}\label{madhava-gregory-series}

What does the equality sign mean for an infinite sum? How can a sum of
rationals equal and irrational number? A transcendental number? The
meaning of \(=\) is therefore not in the sense of \(2 + 2 = 4\) or even
of \(x - 5 = 0\). It is something similar and yet something different,
because, despite Cantor, we have not tamed the idea of infinity yet.
