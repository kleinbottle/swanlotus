summary: This is a sequel to the blog ["The Pi of Archimedes"](https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/the-pi-of-archimedes). We look at π as a number rather than the ratio of two lengths, and try to unravel how and why it is ubiquitous in mathematics.

This is a sequel to the blog ["The Pi of Archimedes"](https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/the-pi-of-archimedes). Here, we look at π as a number---without explicit reference to its geometric tethering---and explore its remarkable ubiquity in mathematics. As an appetizer, see [@fig:pi-equations], where the symbol for Pi is surmounted by two very different equations defining it. How in all the world could these two equations be true? And yet, here indeed are they.

## The Number [Menagerie](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/menagerie)

I like to think that numbers are like animals in a zoo. Each is different, and yet they all share some things in common. The variety and diversity of zoo animals can be challenging. That is why the big cats are grouped together, the herbivores live in another part of the zoo, etc.

Numbers, like animals, have evolved over many centuries into what I call the _number menagerie_. A very elementary picture of this zoo is outlined in my blog ["The Two Most Important Numbers: Zero and One"](https://swanlotus.netlify.app/blogs/the-two-most-important-numbers-zero-and-one) in case you need to review some definitions.

To appreciate $\pi$ as a number, we need to be aware of the [taxonomy] in the zoo of numbers. It turns out that $\pi$ is a real number that is transcendental and therefore also irrational.

### Real and Complex Numbers

We will restrict ourselves to real numberc hereafter.

### Rational and Irrational Numbers

### Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers

We will steer clear of transcendental numbers that are complex because we don't want to get dizzy right at the beginning \emojifong :wink: \normalfont\.

Real Rational Integer Irrational Algebraic Transcendental Complex etc.

Hark back to 

Venn diagram showing the number taxonomy can be challenging [Venn diagram is shown here](https://mathmonks.com/transcendental-numbers). This Venn diagram is flawed.

### Taxonomy

#.  The real numbers are a union of the algebraic and transcendental numbers.

#.  The algebraic numbers can be either rational or irrational.

#.  No rational number is transcendental.

#.  All real transcendental numbers are irrational.

#.  The irrational numbers contain _all_ transcendental numbers ad a subset of the algebraic numbers.

## Madhava-Gregory series

What does the equality sign mean for an infinite sum? How can a sum of rationals equal and irrational number? A transcendental number? The meaning of $=$ is therefore not in the sense of $2 + 2 = 4$ or even of $x - 5 = 0$. It is something similar and yet something different, because, despite Cantor, we have not tamed the idea of infinity yet.
