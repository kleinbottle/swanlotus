# agm-float.jl
# 
# Function to compute the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM)
#  of two positive real numbers, a0, g0.
#
# We use BigFloat for maintaining numerical precision.
#
# The TOLERANCE is the stopping criterion. Its value is fixed here.
# The difference between an and gn should be less than the TOLERANCE 
# for the computation to terminate.
#
# agm(1, âˆš2) is computed and displayed to 25 places after the decimal point
# to compare it with the eleven figures that Gauss got in 1799.
# We also use it to compare with the values quoted in the paper by Cox.
