## Secrets of Academic Success

SwanLotus is the home on the Web for my book [_Secrets of Academic Success_](sas.html). It has been written specifically to help students study effectively and learn better. The book is a [soup to nuts](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/from-soup-to-nuts) exposition on the process of learning. Specific attention is paid to the basic traits and skills underlying successful learning. The completed chapters of the draft manuscript in [PDF format](https://acrobat.adobe.com/in/en/acrobat/about-adobe-pdf.html) may be [downloaded here]({static}../sas-manuscript/SAS-partial.pdf).

## Sanskrit for Spiritual Seekers

The companion website for my evolving manuscript, [_Sanskrit for Spiritual Seekers_](sss.html) is also found here. While I lay no claim to expertise in Sanskrit, I am fascinated by the systematic, almost algorithmic fashion, in which its vocabulary is generated. This book is more like the notes I have written to myself in consequence. Take a look if it interests you.

## Blogs

I also [blog](blogs.html) here on [eclectic](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=eclectic) subjects. Some blogs are short and light. Others are long and heavy, and are better described as _slogs_. :wink:

## Contact

I value and look forward to your ideas for improving _Secrets of Academic Success_ and  this website. Please [email your feedback to me](mailto:feedback.sasbook@gmail.com).

Happy lifelong learning! :smile:
