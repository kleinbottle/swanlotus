_Secrets of Academic Success_ is the title of a book that I have been writing since 2007. It is a [soup to nuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_to_nuts) exposition of how to learn effectively and succeed academically. The book espouses [lifelong learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning) and is suitable for anyone wishing to excel academically, regardless of age, clime, and time.

## Background

I very much wanted to share the fruits of my academic learning experience in a _single volume_, as a go-to resource for matters academic, so that students everywhere might be helped. _Secrets of Academic Success_ is that book.

Accordingly, the book is _very_ long. It is not meant to be read in one go from cover to cover, but rather consulted as and when need arises, or absorbed one topic at a time, so that gradual mastery is accomplished.

## Ten parts

The book is divided into ten parts, each of which addresses one aspect of learning. These are briefly described below:

#.  **You**: Your motivation, habits, etc., are an important ingredient for your success. So, we begin at the beginning.

#.  **Mind**: Listening, seeing, thinking, moods, memory, and related subjects are considered here.

#.  **Resources**: People, libraries, technology, the Web, and such are the subject of this part.

#.  **Study Techniques**: The core material begins here with different study techniques.

#.  **Reading**: The first of the three Rs's, reading is dealt with in detail, including how to match reading depth with reading material.

#.  **Writing**: Perhaps the most important part of the book. Techniques for writing well, including building a vocabulary, and expressing yourself efficiently and fluently are addressed here.

#.  **Mathematics**: Possibly the most dreaded of the three R's is Arithmetic or its mature cousin, Mathematics. Everything---from overcoming a dread of the subject, through popular mathematics texts, avoiding common mistakes, to problem solving and graduation to university mathematics---is covered here.

#.  **Examinations**: Even if unfair, the  ultimate test of your learning is your performance in examinations. Helpful hints on how to prepare for them, how to answer examination questions, etc., are the subject of this part.

#.  **University Studies**: University learning requires a higher level of self-discipline, and helful hints are given to help maintain this. What to look out for if you decide on a PhD, how to write papers and theses, etc., are also discussed in this part.

#.  **Working Life**: Some day, you must leave the halls of learning to earn a living. This part helps you make this transition, while exhorting you to make lifelong learning a habit in your life.
