This is the companion website for my book

![_Sanskrit for Spiritual Seekers_]({static}images/sss-cover.png){width=40%}

It is an evolving manuscript that takes the interested reader through a leisurely journey, exploring Sanskrit as both a language and as a stargate leading to spirituality. It is replete with references that allow the zealous reader to plumb the depths of the language to her or his own satisfaction.

_Sanskrit for Spiritual Seekers_ may be [freely downloaded from here]({static}../sss-manuscript/SSS.pdf).
