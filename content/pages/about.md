## Why SwanLotus?

The swan and the lotus are ancient symbols in the tradition of [Sanātana Dharma](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sanatana-dharma). The swan is a symbol of discrimination, and is the vehicle for [Sarasvatī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati), the Goddess of Learning. The lotus blossom, even though rooted in mud, is unsullied by it, and represents purity and beauty. Sarasvatī is depicted as seated on a white lotus. So, this website, concerned as it is with learning, knowledge, and wisdom, is named SwanLotus.

## The logo

The website logo for SwanLotus is shown below:

The symbol "S" for the swan is in black, because for some periods in my life, I lived in [Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth), Australia, where the [Swan River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_River_(Western_Australia)) flows, and where black swans abound.

The symbol "L" for the lotus is in white, signifying the white lotus:

## The author

My name is R (Chandra) Chandrasekhar. I am a retired biomedical engineer and university academic. I am a lifelong learner. My purpose in setting up this website is twofold.

First, it is the home on the Web for my book-in-preparation entitled [_Secrets of Academic Success_](sas.html). In it I have tried to impart some of the knowledge about studying and learning that my teachers and others have inculcated in me. The book is in electronic form and may be [freely downloaded]({static}../sas-manuscript/SAS-partial.pdf).

Second, I blog on this site, writing about whatever takes my fancy. Many of my blogs are long reads, which I have christened _slogs_. If you display the intellectual fortitude to read them to the end, I salute and thank you. \emojifont:smile:\normalfont

Many of the blogs are from the early days of the Web and have found a second home here. I have taken the opportunity to update them where necessary. They are arranged by the original date, rather than when last modified.

For the curious among you, who wonder what I look like, I have appended two photographs below, taken some decades ago.
