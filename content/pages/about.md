The swan and the lotus are ancient symbols in the tradition of [Sanātana Dharma](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sanatana-dharma). The swan is purported to be able to extract milk from a mixture of milk and water, and thus signifies discrimination. The lotus is rooted in mud, but produces an unsullied blossom, emblematic of purity and beauty.

[Sarasvatī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati), the Goddess of Learning, is depicted as seated on a white lotus, and having a swan for her vehicle. So, this website, concerned as it is with learning, knowledge, and hopefully wisdom, has been named SwanLotus in [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).

## The logo

The website logo for SwanLotus is shown below:

The symbol "S" for the swan is in black, because for some periods of my life, I lived in [Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth), Australia, where the blue [Swan River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_River_(Western_Australia)) flows, and where black swans abound.

The symbol "L" for the lotus is in white, signifying the white lotus:

## The author

My name is R (Chandra) Chandrasekhar. I am a retired biomedical engineer and university academic. I am also a lifelong learner. My purpose in setting up this website is twofold:

#.  It is the Web-home for my book-in-preparation entitled [_Secrets of Academic Success_](sas.html). In it, I have tried to impart some of the knowledge about studying and learning that my various teachers have inculcated in me. The book is in electronic form, and is protected by [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright), with [all rights reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved). It may be [downloaded from here]({static}../sas-manuscript/SAS-partial.pdf) at no charge.

#.  I also [blog](blogs.html) on this site, writing about whatever takes my fancy. Many of my blogs are long reads, which I have christened _slogs_. If you display the intellectual and intestinal fortitude to read them to the end, I salute and thank you. \emojifont:wink:\normalfont

    Many of the blogs are from the early days of the Web and have found a durable home here. I have taken the opportunity to update them where necessary. They are arranged by the original date, rather than when last modified.

For the curious among you, who wonder what I look like, I have appended two photographs below, taken with eminent personages, some decades ago.
