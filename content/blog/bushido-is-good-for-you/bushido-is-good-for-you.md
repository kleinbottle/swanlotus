Pythagoras sat under a tree when an apple fell to the ground, striking
his head on the way. Old Pythagoras saw stars and exclaimed
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ and promptly expired from the blow.

Anaxagoras woke up the next morning and spoke in தமிழ். Next, he declaimed in ελλας. He then constructed Euler’s equation off the top of his head though he had no inkling what *complex numbers* were:
$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i \sin\theta.
$$

`bash` script, again off the top of his head.

#! /bin/bash
echo "Hello World!"

Not to be outdone, **Alice** appeared out of _NeverNeverLand_ and said
“How absolutely _terrible_---I mean each of you speaking a different
tongue!”

@. Here also?

| The limerick packs laughs anatomical
| In space that is quite economical.
|    But the good ones I've seen
|    So seldom are clean
| And the clean ones so seldom are comical
